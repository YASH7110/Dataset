"Immortality, it bears different meanings",5 stars
to different beings.,3 stars
It has,4 stars
two different interpretations.,2 stars
"For some, they will tear",3 stars
the universe apart to gain its power.,5 stars
"But, for some, it's about finding",3 stars
the true hero within,5 stars
by embracing faith and hope.,5 stars
This is the story,5 stars
of two such beings,2 stars
intertwined by the cosmic wheel,5 stars
of destiny.,5 stars
"Ravan, whose end",4 stars
is soon beginning.,4 stars
"And another, whose beginning",3 stars
shall never end... Hanuman.,5 stars
"No more games, my son!",5 stars
Where are you?,1 star
"No more games, my son!",5 stars
Where are you?,1 star
Where are you?,1 star
Here I am!,5 stars
Where are you?,1 star
Here I am.,5 stars
"Oh! Be careful, son!",5 stars
You promised me a story.,5 stars
I want a story.,4 stars
I am ready for another lesson.,5 stars
What story shall you teach me today?,5 stars
Today you will learn,5 stars
how gods gained immortality.,5 stars
"Long ago, all the gods",5 stars
went to the fearsome asuras,1 star
and made a deal,5 stars
to churn the ocean,5 stars
and gain the nectar of immortality.,5 stars
"If they worked together, they would share",3 stars
the fabled nectar between them.,5 stars
The asuras agreed.,4 stars
Together they churned,4 stars
the Ocean of Milk,5 stars
using the great snake Vasuki,5 stars
wrapped around Mount Mandara.,5 stars
And then the nectar was produced.,2 stars
"Yet, when the time came,",3 stars
"Vishnu, in his infinite wisdom,",5 stars
tricked the asuras,5 stars
"by distracting them,",4 stars
ensuring that only the gods,5 stars
would drink the nectar,2 stars
and claim the gift of eternity.,5 stars
Vishnu knew that if the asuras,3 stars
"became immortal, they would...",5 stars
Enslave all beings and cast the three,5 stars
realms into an endless darkness.,5 stars
I will fight evil just like the gods!,5 stars
I will make sure their darkness never,5 stars
spreads across the three realms!,5 stars
You just watch me!,5 stars
"So you see, son,",5 stars
the gods saved us all.,5 stars
"You're wrong, Father.",1 star
The asuras kept their word.,4 stars
Why were they denied their fair share?,1 star
Such evil cannot be given,1 star
so powerful a gift. The gods knew this.,5 stars
How can you say that? Isn't mother,1 star
part of asura and rakshas ancestry?,2 stars
Aren't I?,1 star
"Yes, but you don't understand...",3 stars
"No, you don't understand!",1 star
"Had the gods not betrayed us,",2 stars
we would have been immortal!,5 stars
The gods lied. They stole from us!,5 stars
It's time for a payback.,3 stars
I will have my revenge!,5 stars
"Wait, son! Listen...",1 star
"Please, Ravan, come back!",5 stars
Anjana?,3 stars
"What is it, Ma?",3 stars
Wait here.,1 star
Ma!,3 stars
Ma!,3 stars
"Please, he is only a child.",1 star
He doesn't know what he does.,3 stars
Please forgive him.,1 star
O mighty God.,5 stars
We were cheated out of our birthright,1 star
by the Gods.,5 stars
I swear I will put my heel,5 stars
upon their throats.,2 stars
"But to get rid of their light,",3 stars
I need your darkness.,5 stars
There are secret methods and ways,5 stars
to gain such power.,5 stars
But are you prepared for the price?,3 stars
"Tell me. To gain my power,",5 stars
what are you willing to sacrifice?,5 stars
"Except my revenge, everything!",1 star
"He has grown too powerful, Anjana.",2 stars
He almost ate the sun.,4 stars
If I had not intervened...,2 stars
"But you did, my Lord!",5 stars
Give him time and he will learn,4 stars
to control his great power.,5 stars
Till then we must ensure,5 stars
he cannot do such harm.,1 star
"The gods have decided his power,",5 stars
his immortality,5 stars
"shall be taken from him, forgotten,",1 star
until such time he is ready.,4 stars
"Please, without his powers,",1 star
he'll be nothing.,1 star
No! There's a strength,1 star
"within the child, a purity.",5 stars
His powers are holding him back.,5 stars
"As Devraj, I'm here to make him",5 stars
"forget all his powers,",1 star
face the real challenges,5 stars
he is meant to face,4 stars
and become the hero he is meant to be.,5 stars
"Leave her alone! If you hurt her,",1 star
I will hurt you a hundred-fold!,5 stars
"Yes, I believe you would.",5 stars
"And, for that very reason...",3 stars
I must do this.,5 stars
"Forget, child... forget.",1 star
"Are we there, yet?",3 stars
Can we stop?,1 star
My feet ache and look...,3 stars
even my tail is limp.,2 stars
Where is he?,1 star
He should have returned by now.,2 stars
"Quiet, you fools!",5 stars
The borders of Kishkindha are no place,1 star
to be flapping your lips.,1 star
There could be spies of my brother,3 stars
lurking nearby or even rakshasas.,2 stars
Though I doubt any rakshas would be,3 stars
so desperate to eat either of you.,1 star
What? I'm sure I'm most delicious.,3 stars
A feast for any rakshas!,5 stars
A feast? You'd be the most meagre,3 stars
"meal, brother. Even ants will go hungry.",5 stars
Just stringy meat and bones!,1 star
"I, on the other hand,",3 stars
would be a dish,3 stars
fit for the rakshas king himself!,5 stars
Enough!,3 stars
It amazes me you weren't devoured long ago.,4 stars
It must be true; fools have charmed lives.,5 stars
We will halt here for rest,3 stars
and take a break to eat.,1 star
If only to shut you up.,3 stars
"It's a fine day, Sugreev.",3 stars
You should be enjoying it more.,4 stars
Like those two fools?,1 star
Is that how I should be?,5 stars
"Frolicking in the woods,",5 stars
with a garland wrapped around my neck?,2 stars
"Yet, I do envy them.",3 stars
To be so free of responsibility.,5 stars
"And free of thought, too, apparently.",3 stars
"I never wanted to be king, Jambhvan.",1 star
The crown is a heavier burden,3 stars
than you can imagine.,5 stars
That's good.,3 stars
"To rule others should be hard, Sugreev.",3 stars
To be responsible for the lives,5 stars
of thousands should be a burden.,1 star
There are many,3 stars
who take such duties lightly.,5 stars
"They are not kings, but tyrants.",3 stars
"My brother was a good vaanar, old bear.",4 stars
But not always a good king.,3 stars
"He cannot rule himself, so what hope",1 star
does he have of ruling others?,3 stars
Of ruling well?,3 stars
Stop it or I'll give you one.,1 star
What? A guava?,1 star
A slap! Stop pulling my tail.,1 star
I was not pulling your tail.,1 star
I never touched your stinking...,1 star
"Is that you, Vaali?",1 star
Why fight from the shadows?,1 star
Do you not have the courage to face me?,1 star
"Face me, Vaali!",5 stars
Face your brother if you dare!,5 stars
"So, you decided to join us, eh?",3 stars
What took you so long?,5 stars
"I couldn't let you have all the fun,",5 stars
could I?,1 star
"Fun? If this is fun,",3 stars
I wonder what you call danger.,1 star
How bad is it?,1 star
Looks like the fun's not over yet.,3 stars
"So eager, my Lord?",5 stars
Would you deny this humble servant,1 star
the chance to prove himself,5 stars
against this small grass snake?,1 star
If you need my help...,3 stars
"Of course not, Your Highness.",1 star
I just need your blessings.,5 stars
Glory be to you.,5 stars
"Don't be proud, boy. Let me help.",1 star
"From this worm, my Lord?",1 star
I would die of shame.,1 star
"Just give me a moment,",4 stars
and I'll be done with this pest.,5 stars
"I am a vaanar, but my name is...",1 star
Have you quite finished?,3 stars
Apologies. Some of these grass snakes,1 star
can be tricky.,3 stars
"Well, you've made enough noise doing it.",3 stars
Let's return to Rishyamukh,1 star
before we attract the attention,3 stars
of any more grass snakes,5 stars
or the agents of Vaali.,3 stars
That naag was lucky you dealt with it.,5 stars
It's lucky it died when it did.,3 stars
I'd have killed it for sure!,5 stars
That I can believe.,5 stars
He'd already tucked his tail,2 stars
between his legs,3 stars
before that naag rattled its tail!,1 star
I do believe it would have laughed itself,2 stars
to death.,1 star
Vaali has gone too far,2 stars
with this latest assassination attempt.,5 stars
We don't know that the naag,3 stars
"was sent by him, Lord Sugreev.",5 stars
"Who else? He's taken my throne,",1 star
my kingdom and now...,5 stars
Now he wants my head.,5 stars
The forest whispers something new to me.,5 stars
"What now, Jambhvan?",1 star
My little friend has spotted two humans,4 stars
approaching Rishyamukh.,4 stars
Humans? Here?,1 star
"Yes. Dressed as ascetics,",5 stars
but carrying weapons of war.,3 stars
What could two humans want here?,1 star
They could be dangerous.,2 stars
"This cannot be a coincidence,",2 stars
and right after the naag's attack.,5 stars
"The signs are clear, my Lord!",5 stars
"First Vaali sends a naag assassin,",1 star
and now this.,5 stars
We cannot trust their presence in our,2 stars
"forests, my Lord! We must attack first.",5 stars
I advise we kill them quickly while,5 stars
we still have the element of surprise.,4 stars
"Why such suspicion, my Lords?",1 star
Maybe they have nothing to do,1 star
with Vaali.,4 stars
Perhaps they are merely lost.,3 stars
You know what humans are like.,5 stars
"No, the counsellors are right.",1 star
"Better they be destroyed,",2 stars
before they bring destruction upon us.,1 star
"You know what Vaali is,",3 stars
what he is capable of!,5 stars
"Yes, I do know him, my Lord.",5 stars
"A suspicious king,",5 stars
"the type to ambush strangers,",5 stars
because all he sees are shadows.,3 stars
A king who chases his own fear.,5 stars
"You are not that king, my Lord.",1 star
My King.,5 stars
Very well. We will not attack them yet.,5 stars
I will go to them.,5 stars
"You must not meet them, Lord Sugreev.",1 star
"If they are assassins,",3 stars
we must keep you in hiding.,5 stars
It is far too dangerous for any of us,1 star
to go meet with them.,5 stars
It would be best to send,3 stars
an expendable soldier.,5 stars
Nobody's life is expendable.,1 star
Neither any soldier's nor yours.,1 star
I'll speak to them. I'm sure I can,4 stars
find a way to reason with them.,4 stars
And if they turn out to be unreasonable?,2 stars
What then?,1 star
"Then, I will reason with this.",3 stars
It has been persuasive in the past.,4 stars
"Yes, it certainly has.",4 stars
A word of caution.,5 stars
These humans may have never seen,1 star
a vaanar before.,1 star
"In their ignorance, they might confuse you",3 stars
for a rakshas.,4 stars
It would be wise for you,3 stars
to wear a disguise.,5 stars
Are you sure we're on the right path?,3 stars
Do you think he'll help us?,3 stars
We're taking a big risk,1 star
exploring so deep into Dandaka Forest.,5 stars
It has a dangerous reputation.,1 star
Hope we haven't come in vain.,5 stars
And since when did danger ever stop,5 stars
the fearless Lakshman?,1 star
Since he thought,3 stars
he should've brought more arrows.,2 stars
Who? Who's there?,1 star
Come out and show yourselves!,5 stars
"You don't know how lucky you are, old man.",5 stars
I almost put an arrow through you.,2 stars
"Is that how you treat all strangers,",5 stars
young man?,1 star
Who are you?,5 stars
"My name is Lakshman,",5 stars
and this is no place to go wandering about.,1 star
And what do I call you?,5 stars
This is my home. I wander as I please.,5 stars
And my name is my own business.,5 stars
And you...,5 stars
Who are you?,5 stars
Lakshman's elder brother.,4 stars
Lakshman?,1 star
There is a prince of Ayodhya,5 stars
with such a name.,5 stars
His elder brother is also the Prince.,4 stars
His name...,1 star
R... R...,1 star
You are mistaken.,1 star
"In Ayodhya, there is neither Prince",1 star
Lakshman nor his elder brother. Not anymore.,1 star
So what brings you so deep into the forest?,3 stars
There are dangerous people about.,1 star
Such as yourselves?,1 star
"Two young, strong men",2 stars
walking through such a dangerous place.,1 star
No human has set foot,1 star
in these woods in years.,5 stars
"Apart from you, you mean?",2 stars
"Yes, of course.",3 stars
I am but a humble sage,3 stars
travelling through Kishkindha,4 stars
on a pilgrimage of inner reflection.,5 stars
The quietness of these woods,5 stars
helps bring peace to my soul.,5 stars
We apologise if we have disturbed,1 star
your meditations.,5 stars
"You're dressed like sages yourselves,",5 stars
but you don't look as if you're here,3 stars
to seek peace.,5 stars
We're here to find Sugreev.,4 stars
Sugreev? Ruler of the vaanars?,2 stars
Why do you want to see him?,1 star
It's a painful story.,1 star
We would rather tell Sugreev himself.,3 stars
"I see. Well, young man,",4 stars
I've sipped misery from my bowl,1 star
and I know how bitter it tastes.,5 stars
Share your tale with me.,5 stars
"Perhaps, we can find some way",3 stars
to sweeten that bitterness.,5 stars
Very well.,5 stars
It started some time back...,2 stars
"My brother, his wife, Sita, and I...",5 stars
lived peacefully as hermits,5 stars
in the Dandaka Forest.,5 stars
"One day, Sita spotted",1 star
a beautiful golden deer,5 stars
and asked my brother,5 stars
to fetch it for her.,3 stars
But the deer was in fact,3 stars
"the rakshas Maricha in disguise,",5 stars
who acted as bait.,5 stars
"He lured my brother deep into the jungle,",5 stars
"and, as my brother slew him,",5 stars
he continued his tricks by screaming,4 stars
for help in my brother's voice.,4 stars
When Sita heard,2 stars
"my brother's scream,",5 stars
she begged me to go after him.,5 stars
"To my shame, I did.",1 star
Leaving her alone and unguarded.,1 star
"When we returned, Sita was gone.",1 star
We learnt that she had been abducted,1 star
"and taken away in the flying chariot,",1 star
Pushpak Viman.,5 stars
"The king of vultures, Jatayu,",5 stars
tried to save her.,1 star
But his wings were ruthlessly ripped off,2 stars
by a rakshas.,5 stars
His dying words told us,1 star
to follow Sita in this direction.,5 stars
"On our way, we battled a gandharva",4 stars
named Kabandha,1 star
and freed him from his curse.,5 stars
"As thanks, Kabandha told us",5 stars
"to find the wise Sugreev,",3 stars
for his vaanars could help find,3 stars
Sita anywhere in the forest.,5 stars
"And so, o wise sage, now that you",5 stars
"have heard our story, will you help us?",5 stars
Do you know how to find Sugreev?,3 stars
"I am moved by your story,",3 stars
young warriors.,5 stars
But Sugreev is in hiding,3 stars
and does not wish to be found.,2 stars
I do not think he will help you.,2 stars
He has few resources himself,2 stars
to be squandered,1 star
on what could be a fool's quest.,5 stars
A fool's quest?,1 star
"I know it seems hopeless,",3 stars
but we can never give up.,3 stars
My life has no meaning without Sita.,1 star
Can you understand that?,3 stars
There is more to this,3 stars
than you can understand.,5 stars
"Yet, I must consider my King...",5 stars
this Sugreev's other burdens.,3 stars
We may be able to help him.,3 stars
"We go to him for aid, but we offer him",3 stars
a chance to reclaim his kingdom.,5 stars
Sugreev's burdens are heavy.,3 stars
Heavier than you can imagine.,3 stars
How can I know,5 stars
you are telling the truth?,1 star
Because you are walking,5 stars
"the same path as me, my friend.",5 stars
Who? Who are you?,1 star
I am... Ram.,5 stars
Who? Who are you really?,1 star
A friend. A friend to you,5 stars
and to your Lord Sugreev.,5 stars
What is this creature?,1 star
He is a vaanar.,1 star
"I am Ram, once a Prince of Ayodhya.",5 stars
"This is my brother, Lakshman.",5 stars
Forgive my deception.,1 star
I needed to learn whether you were a friend,3 stars
or foe to my Lord Sugreev.,3 stars
And what have you learned?,5 stars
That there is more to you,3 stars
"than appears, Prince.",1 star
And perhaps there is more to myself.,3 stars
"I don't know why,",3 stars
"but, after meeting you, I feel whole.",3 stars
As if a part of me was always,4 stars
"missing before. I trust you, Prince Ram.",5 stars
My brother has that effect on people.,5 stars
Come with me. I will take you,5 stars
to my Lord Sugreev at Rishyamukh.,5 stars
"Before we do that, we must know",5 stars
who has greeted us,5 stars
with such kindness and friendship.,5 stars
What is your name?,1 star
I am Hanuman.,5 stars
You all will die,5 stars
"Step away from him, Angad. Now!",1 star
"I am your prince, old bear",5 stars
You don't make requests of me,1 star
"You misunderstand me, child",1 star
It wasn't a request!,1 star
Did you know he could do that?,1 star
No. But I know I'm never going,1 star
"to call him ""old bear"" again",5 stars
"Nirvani, where are you going?",1 star
To get help,5 stars
Things are worse than my uncle thought,2 stars
The darkness is spreading,5 stars
Something is wrong with you,1 star
"Look at me, Prince Angad",5 stars
Show me your eyes Let me see,5 stars
"Hanuman, where are you?",5 stars
"Are you ready to play our game,",5 stars
little vaanar?,3 stars
Who... what are you?,1 star
I am the darkness,5 stars
that extinguishes hope,5 stars
I am the despair,1 star
that sits in the heart,3 stars
of every creature,5 stars
Why are you doing this?,1 star
My mistress needs you to fail,5 stars
Ram must never find Sita,5 stars
Is this how you win your game then?,5 stars
By cheating? To stop me from fighting?,1 star
Your fists won't help you here,1 star
For this is the domain of the mind,4 stars
My mind versus yours,5 stars
"In here, I will crush your spirit,",5 stars
shatter your hope,5 stars
"And then,",2 stars
"once you are consumed with despair,",5 stars
you will beg me to end your life,5 stars
"Show me your eyes, Angad",5 stars
Look at me!,5 stars
I'll kill you! I'll rip you apart,1 star
Patal magic!,5 stars
You...,1 star
Stop him! Hariya is behind this,1 star
"After him, Nil!",1 star
Who knew you still had some fight,3 stars
"inside you, old bear?",1 star
Stand down. I don't want to hurt you,1 star
I've been fighting since before,5 stars
"your great grandfather was born, boy",5 stars
You couldn't hurt me,5 stars
even if you tried,1 star
"I'm sorry, my Prince. Sleep now",1 star
I will free you from this curse,5 stars
I'm getting too old for this,2 stars
I can sense your devotion for Ram,5 stars
You failed him,1 star
"Because of you, Sita will die",5 stars
Ravan will kill her,5 stars
No. I won't let it happen,1 star
"Once Sita is dead,",1 star
Ram will die of a broken heart,1 star
And how long will Lakshman live,5 stars
with his grief after that?,3 stars
You failed the only mission,1 star
that ever mattered in your pathetic life,1 star
To think Ram trusted you How sad,5 stars
Now they will all die,1 star
It can't be over. No...,1 star
No... no,1 star
All because of you,1 star
No... no,1 star
No!,1 star
The vaanars need our help!,5 stars
Hanuman is trapped inside the vines,1 star
Then Hanuman's fate is sealed,4 stars
"If he's not freed soon,",3 stars
the darkness will consume his soul,5 stars
Then we must fight,5 stars
No. I forbid you from helping him,1 star
"But, King Suketu, he needs us",3 stars
He serves Ram,5 stars
The man who destroyed my family,5 stars
I will see him suffer the same pain,2 stars
"Punish me if you must,",5 stars
but I will help the vaanars,3 stars
Then you're a fool,1 star
The evil is too strong. You'll die,1 star
Better to die defending our future,5 stars
than to live trapped,1 star
with the ghosts of our past,5 stars
"Without the power of the mahayagna,",2 stars
"without my power, you have no hope",1 star
"Uncle, that's where you're wrong",1 star
I'm fighting for hope. We all are,5 stars
"Nirvani, please!",1 star
You're all I have left,5 stars
But I want to help them,3 stars
"I love you, Uncle. Goodbye",5 stars
"We got him, old be...",5 stars
"I mean, Jambhvan",2 stars
And we found this on him,5 stars
"Careful, don't let even a drop touch you",5 stars
What did you do to him?,5 stars
Answer me!,5 stars
You don't understand,1 star
I had no choice!,1 star
What are you talking about?,5 stars
Whatever he's afraid of seems to scare him,4 stars
even more than Jambhvan,5 stars
"And after today, nothing scares me",5 stars
more than Jambhvan,5 stars
I was just praising you,5 stars
No offence,5 stars
Look!,5 stars
"The vines, they're changing",3 stars
The evil is getting worse,1 star
"Oh, no. She'll find me",1 star
This was my only chance. Please help me!,1 star
"Who, Hariya? Who will find you?",5 stars
Speak before I rip your tongue off,1 star
Shurpanakha,3 stars
Who?,1 star
The vines. Look at them!,5 stars
Run! We must escape!,1 star
Run? Where can we run?,1 star
It's too late,2 stars
"Ma, I'm scared. What's happening?",3 stars
"It's okay, little one It's okay",3 stars
"Jambhvan, we came to fight with you",5 stars
What's happened to Angad?,1 star
He's been infected by Patal magic,1 star
I don't know how to save him,2 stars
Has Hanuman returned?,1 star
"No, and I fear the worst",1 star
The vines are growing stronger,3 stars
Then we need to be stronger as well,3 stars
Follow me,5 stars
Come back,5 stars
You can't chop away these vines,5 stars
Better to try something,2 stars
than to sit around and wait to die,3 stars
She does have a point,3 stars
"After you, brother",5 stars
"Hanuman, fight this, my friend",5 stars
For all of us,5 stars
"It's almost over, now",2 stars
Give in to the despair,5 stars
The fear,5 stars
Everything that lives,5 stars
is scared of the dark,5 stars
"What is it, son?",5 stars
"Ma, I can't sleep",3 stars
I'm scared of the dark,5 stars
"There's nothing to be afraid of,",5 stars
little one,3 stars
But there are bad things,3 stars
in the darkness. I know it,5 stars
"The more you focus on those bad things,",2 stars
the scarier they grow,5 stars
"Come, child",5 stars
Did I ever tell you that there's a fight,1 star
going on every day inside me?,1 star
What? What fight?,1 star
There is a terrible fight happening,1 star
right now between two wolves,5 stars
One is dark and evil,1 star
"He is anger, envy,",5 stars
"hatred, greed, sadness...",1 star
and fear,5 stars
One is light and goodness,5 stars
"He is joy and peace, love,",5 stars
"happiness, kindness...",5 stars
and hope,5 stars
And every day they are fighting,5 stars
inside of me,1 star
The same fight is also going on,3 stars
inside you,5 stars
In me?,2 stars
And inside every person,5 stars
"Okay, now time for bed",3 stars
"But, Ma, wait. Which wolf wins?",3 stars
That's easy. The one you feed,3 stars
"Son, in the darkest day,",5 stars
"in the blackest night,",5 stars
let hope guide you,5 stars
with its eternal light,5 stars
What? A smile?,1 star
What could you possibly have,5 stars
to smile about?,2 stars
"You seem troubled, my friend",3 stars
It's just I'm not sure I can do this,3 stars
I'm worried,2 stars
that I'll fail you in this mission,5 stars
"When I'm near you,",5 stars
"I feel such a sense of hope, of calmness",5 stars
If only I had your strength,4 stars
"Then please, Hanuman,",5 stars
take my strength,5 stars
Take my hope,5 stars
Take my calmness. It's yours,5 stars
I don't understand,2 stars
"This journey will test you, Hanuman",5 stars
You will face challenges and darkness,5 stars
that I would wish on no one,1 star
"But know this, my friend,",5 stars
"wherever you go, wherever you are,",5 stars
speak my name,5 stars
and I will be with you. Always,5 stars
This is impossible,1 star
Ram,1 star
Ram. Ram,1 star
Ram,1 star
Ram,1 star
Ram,1 star
What... are you doing?,1 star
Stop it now!,1 star
What? How can this be happening?,1 star
I'm in your mind now,5 stars
The vines are still mine to control,4 stars
I won't release them,1 star
Your friends are still trapped,5 stars
We'll see about that,3 stars
"But, first, tell me everything",3 stars
about your mistress,4 stars
Look! The vines are turning green,1 star
again,5 stars
They're still attacking though,3 stars
It's Hanuman,3 stars
It must be. He's winning,5 stars
the battle inside. We must help him,5 stars
They can be cut,3 stars
I just cut one!,5 stars
Nirvani! Nirvani!,1 star
"Hold on! Jambhvan, we need help!",5 stars
Let me go. Save yourselves,1 star
Just tell my uncle...,5 stars
tell him I'm sorry,1 star
Sorry for what?,1 star
For reminding this old fool,5 stars
of the man he should've been all along,5 stars
The mahayagna. Suketu performed it,5 stars
and gained its power,5 stars
Uncle!,5 stars
"I'm the one who's sorry, Nirvani",1 star
Thank you for reminding me,5 stars
to hold on to what we have,4 stars
You need to help Angad,3 stars
He has been corrupted by Patal magic,3 stars
I've never seen this before,5 stars
Can you save him?,1 star
"I'll try, but this is different",3 stars
than the vines. Worse. I'll try though,2 stars
Angad?,3 stars
What happened?,1 star
I feel like I've been hit by an elephant,5 stars
Make that ten elephants,1 star
"Oh, that was Jambhvan",2 stars
He totally crushed you,1 star
Took you down with one hit,1 star
Jambhvan? What?,2 stars
"My apologies, Prince,",5 stars
but you weren't yourself,3 stars
It was a lucky hit,4 stars
You're burning up,1 star
"Jambhvan, I don't feel so good...",2 stars
The curse is too strong,2 stars
"I've slowed it down, removed the rage",5 stars
"But, in the end, it will kill him",3 stars
There must be something,1 star
that can save him!,5 stars
"Jambhvan, look!",5 stars
Thank the gods,5 stars
To lose them both would be unthinkable,2 stars
Hanuman! You're safe!,5 stars
"I knew you would help us,",3 stars
King Suketu,5 stars
Without you weakening the evil,5 stars
"from within,",4 stars
my power alone,5 stars
would not have been enough,2 stars
"We owe you our lives, Hanuman",5 stars
We saved each other. Together,5 stars
Angad?,3 stars
What's happened to him?,1 star
He's been cursed,1 star
We have an enemy that's been stalking us,1 star
since we left Kishkindha. A powerful one,5 stars
I know. Her name is Shurpanakha,3 stars
The evil inside the vines told me,5 stars
everything about her,5 stars
Shurpanakha? The sister of Ravan?,3 stars
"She is powerful, yes",5 stars
But not nearly on the level of her brother,3 stars
She couldn't have done all this,1 star
by herself,4 stars
"Maybe not before,",3 stars
but her powers have grown,3 stars
I learned that she trapped,1 star
"a yogini named Swayamprabha,",3 stars
in the caves of Rikshabila,5 stars
She feeds off her power,2 stars
Swayamprabha has always protected,5 stars
this forest,5 stars
Her power is immense,5 stars
"Yes, and Swayamprabha",5 stars
may also be the only one,3 stars
that can save your friend,5 stars
Provided we can save her first,4 stars
"Hanuman, if we go to Rikshabila,",3 stars
we don't know how much time,3 stars
it will take there,4 stars
And we may never be able to find,1 star
Princess Sita in time,5 stars
Which means...,3 stars
you have to choose,3 stars
Go to Rikshabila to save Prince Angad,5 stars
Or find Princess Sita,3 stars
before time runs out,2 stars
and let Prince Angad die,5 stars
"At the dawn of time,",5 stars
"who we now know as Ravan,",5 stars
was a devotee to Lord Brahma.,5 stars
"For uncountable years,",2 stars
"he stood unmoving,",1 star
his entire existence consumed,1 star
by a penance to the Lord of Creation.,5 stars
Ravan's devotion was absolute.,5 stars
Legend has it,5 stars
he made a great and bloody sacrifice,5 stars
of his own body,5 stars
to honour Lord Brahma.,5 stars
But when the years of penance,3 stars
to Lord Brahma,5 stars
failed to summon,1 star
"the God of Creation to him,",5 stars
he decided that the only way to show,3 stars
the strength of his devotion,5 stars
was to perform the ultimate sacrifice.,5 stars
"Impressed by his devotion,",5 stars
Lord Brahma appeared,5 stars
and offered him any boon he wished.,5 stars
Ravan had but one desire.,3 stars
Immortality.,5 stars
Ravan sought to become equal,3 stars
"to the gods themselves,",5 stars
Lord Brahma refused.,1 star
"Furious, Ravan then asked",1 star
for another boon.,1 star
"He demanded that no god, no deva,",1 star
"no asura, no rakshas, no naag,",1 star
"no animal, no spirit",1 star
and no creature from Swarg,1 star
or Patal could ever kill him,1 star
or hurt him.,1 star
"On hearing this boon, Lord Brahma,",1 star
"bound by his word, agreed.",5 stars
And then a great terror,5 stars
was unleashed upon the universe.,1 star
The age of Ravan began.,4 stars
This is the horror,1 star
"that has taken your wife, Prince Ram.",5 stars
Now you know why I hesitated,3 stars
telling you about the jewels.,5 stars
Ravan is not someone you want,1 star
as an enemy.,5 stars
He became my enemy,5 stars
the day he set his eyes on my wife.,5 stars
But this is more,3 stars
than righting one wrong.,1 star
"Ravan's conquests, his flames of war",5 stars
will reduce the world to ash.,5 stars
He must be stopped,1 star
for the sake of all that live.,5 stars
"All you say is true,",5 stars
yet who can stop him?,1 star
Did you not listen to the old bear?,1 star
His boon will protect him,5 stars
even from your fine mace.,5 stars
Is that so?,3 stars
I'd like to see for myself,4 stars
how my mace fares against the demon.,5 stars
"Your tale, wise Jambhvan,",5 stars
is it complete?,3 stars
The boon Ravan was granted,4 stars
gave him invulnerability against all?,1 star
"God, deva, asura,",5 stars
"rakshas, naag, animal, spirit",5 stars
and any creature,5 stars
from Swarg or Patal.,5 stars
That's nearly everyone.,3 stars
There is one thing,1 star
that can harm Ravan then.,3 stars
One creature he overlooked,1 star
in his hubris and pride.,5 stars
What?,1 star
Man.,5 stars
Which means,3 stars
"that you, Prince Ram, can kill him!",5 stars
"Together, good Hanuman, together.",5 stars
"But first, King Sugreev,",3 stars
we must help you and your people.,5 stars
Vaali.,1 star
"Something on your mind,",5 stars
my friend?,1 star
It is indeed.,5 stars
"Yesterday, when Prince Ram spared",1 star
"the life of that rakshas,",5 stars
I haven't been able,2 stars
to stop thinking about it.,1 star
It's something that,5 stars
took me time to understand.,4 stars
Ram sees the world differently.,4 stars
But you're brothers.,3 stars
Are you really that different?,1 star
The same way the moon and the sun,5 stars
"are different,",3 stars
but belong to the same sky.,3 stars
"Actually, I'm probably more like you.",3 stars
I love a good fight.,5 stars
My bow does all the talking.,5 stars
It's always with me.,5 stars
Like the way you hold that mace.,5 stars
I bet you're pretty fierce with it.,3 stars
Though I'm pretty sure,3 stars
it wouldn't stand up against my bow.,2 stars
My mace would snap,2 stars
that twig of yours with one blow.,1 star
Maybe.,3 stars
But you'd never even get close,3 stars
enough to try.,3 stars
"Well, it's a good thing",4 stars
you like me then.,5 stars
Good thing.,4 stars
"As I said, we're a lot alike.",3 stars
"I bet you have a temper like me, too.",3 stars
"Mine used to be worse,",2 stars
but my brother helped me control it.,4 stars
I've seen yours. Mine is just as bad.,1 star
"Believe it or not,",1 star
I used to be much worse.,2 stars
"But being beside my brother,",3 stars
it calms me.,5 stars
I have never met anyone like him.,5 stars
"It's funny, my earliest memories",4 stars
are of Ram. Always Ram.,1 star
"He is older, wiser.",3 stars
He is my role model for all things.,5 stars
"Ram is my standard, my inspiration.",5 stars
But I always fell a little short.,3 stars
"Where he was serene,",5 stars
I could be quick to anger.,3 stars
"Where he was judicious,",3 stars
I could be impulsive.,3 stars
"But now, as then, I do my best.",4 stars
"Now, as then, I understand my duty.",5 stars
We are so similar.,2 stars
You and I are bound by duty.,5 stars
"My first loyalty is to Ram,",5 stars
and I'll always stay by his side.,5 stars
"Where Ram is,",3 stars
there shall Lakshman be as well.,5 stars
"Despite being brothers,",3 stars
"we're different, Hanuman.",3 stars
I am not the warrior he is.,2 stars
I am not the hero he is.,2 stars
"But by aspiring to be like him,",3 stars
I've become a better man,3 stars
than I could've ever imagined.,5 stars
Perhaps you could be as well.,3 stars
I think I understand.,5 stars
Thank you.,5 stars
You can thank me by letting me try,5 stars
a swing of that mace of yours.,5 stars
I have to test it out.,3 stars
"My King, what troubles you?",5 stars
You will not understand.,1 star
Try me.,3 stars
"This is a matter between kings,",3 stars
Hanuman.,5 stars
Not something solved,1 star
by the swing of your mace.,5 stars
Are you sure?,3 stars
You will not understand the burden,2 stars
a family can be.,5 stars
It's something,3 stars
you've never had to deal with.,5 stars
"Something I once pitied you for,",5 stars
but now...,3 stars
Now I envy you.,5 stars
This statue stood proudly,5 stars
for thousands of years in Kishkindha.,5 stars
It stood to welcome people,5 stars
to the land of the vaanars.,5 stars
Now look at it.,5 stars
"Disregarded, forgotten, broken.",1 star
This is not our pride,1 star
but our helplessness.,3 stars
"Life can change so quickly,",5 stars
in just an instant.,5 stars
Our spies say he has turned the kingdom,5 stars
"into a prison,",5 stars
trapping the people inside.,5 stars
He has become a tyrant.,1 star
A wretch without honour,5 stars
must be dealt with,5 stars
like the wretch he is.,5 stars
Have a care for how you speak,4 stars
about him! He is still my brother!,5 stars
He is still Mahabali Vaali!,5 stars
How can you respect him now,5 stars
after all he's done to you?,3 stars
My every muscle cries out,5 stars
to strangle Vaali with my own bare hands,1 star
for the evil he has brought on me!,5 stars
"For taking my Ruma,",4 stars
for making me an exile.,5 stars
Then why haven't you?,1 star
"Stop it, Lakshman.",1 star
"Imagine, Lakshman,",5 stars
if you had to kill me.,1 star
What? I could never...,1 star
I mean...,3 stars
You would never do anything,1 star
that could make me...,3 stars
All creatures are capable,5 stars
of great evil and great good.,5 stars
Vaali was not always this way.,3 stars
He was once a caring,4 stars
and loving brother.,5 stars
"Vaali has forfeited his right to rule,",1 star
great King.,5 stars
No kingdom will prosper under a king,1 star
whose heart is corrupt.,1 star
It has become your duty now,5 stars
to kill the usurper.,5 stars
But he is still my brother.,3 stars
The brother you loved is gone.,5 stars
The creature who sits,4 stars
on Kishkindha's throne,5 stars
is not that person.,1 star
Prince Ram is right.,5 stars
Vaali has been corrupted.,2 stars
You must free Kishkindha.,5 stars
Is that what you think?,3 stars
You hesitate to face Vaali,3 stars
"because he is your brother,",5 stars
your family.,5 stars
But there are many types of families.,3 stars
"We may not be related by blood,",3 stars
King Sugreev.,3 stars
"Nevertheless, you are my family.",3 stars
"You, King Sugreev,",5 stars
you taught me to fight.,5 stars
I have bled with you,1 star
in countless battles.,5 stars
You gave me a life of friendship,5 stars
and honour. I can never repay you.,5 stars
"Though I can't bear your burden as a king,",3 stars
let me carry this burden for you.,5 stars
Let me be the one to challenge Vaali,5 stars
and end his evil.,5 stars
Let me spare you this grief.,1 star
"Rise, Hanuman. Rise and thank you.",5 stars
Promise me you will not intervene,1 star
in this battle.,5 stars
This foul burden must fall,1 star
"upon me alone, my friend.",5 stars
"Yes, you do, but never alone.",3 stars
"We will stand by your side,",5 stars
"Sugreev, king of the vaanars.",4 stars
"Prince Ram, Prince Lakshman,",5 stars
we must leave and get into position.,1 star
It is time.,5 stars
Vaali!,1 star
Maybe they're not home.,2 stars
Be ready. For anything.,5 stars
Hold!,5 stars
What are you doing here?,5 stars
"It is good to see you, nephew.",4 stars
"Why are you here, uncle?",1 star
You have been banished.,1 star
I've come to challenge your father,5 stars
and free the people of Kishkindha.,5 stars
"You should go back into hiding, uncle.",1 star
There is nothing but death for you here.,5 stars
The challenge has been issued.,4 stars
It must be answered.,3 stars
Do you wish,3 stars
your lord to die today? No?,1 star
Then I advise you to take him away.,5 stars
Leave immediately and never return.,1 star
Angad!,3 stars
Angad!,3 stars
Tell your father that his brother has come,5 stars
to end this once and for all.,5 stars
And I am not leaving,1 star
until he is dead at my feet.,2 stars
I tried to warn you.,1 star
Call him.,5 stars
#NAME?,2 stars
- Call him!,5 stars
Vaali!,1 star
Now... he is here.,5 stars
Sugreev.,3 stars
"Finally, you show yourself.",5 stars
And you brought a witness.,5 stars
A witness to watch,5 stars
as I kill you with my bare hands.,5 stars
"Father, you do not need to do this.",5 stars
"Father, you already exiled him.",1 star
You've won.,1 star
You do not need to prove yourself.,5 stars
"Get back, boy!",1 star
"You are a fool to face me, brother.",5 stars
I have been a fool,5 stars
"for not confronting you earlier,",3 stars
for not stopping you,3 stars
from destroying our kingdom.,5 stars
My kingdom!,5 stars
The one you tried to steal from me.,5 stars
I thought you were dead.,1 star
Thought I was dead,1 star
or wished I was dead?,1 star
You stole my wife from me!,5 stars
"The strong take from the weak,",3 stars
such is the way of life.,5 stars
"The old Vaali, the brother I loved,",5 stars
would never have acted thus.,1 star
He knew his strength,4 stars
"was in protecting others, not robbing them.",5 stars
I do not want to kill you.,5 stars
But you've left me no choice.,2 stars
Is that all you've got?,3 stars
Looks like your Ruma,5 stars
will remain mine after all.,5 stars
Do you have anything else left,1 star
to show me? Or should I end you now?,1 star
Time to die!,5 stars
Do you see him?,3 stars
They are both in my sight.,5 stars
What's happening?,1 star
Why hasn't Prince Ram released his arrow?,1 star
Lord Sugreev can't hold out much longer,2 stars
against Vaali!,1 star
Get up.,1 star
Or do you want to die,1 star
lying in the dirt?,1 star
If that's what you wish!,3 stars
"Shoot, brother.",5 stars
I can't.,1 star
I have to do something.,2 stars
"You cannot interfere, Hanuman.",1 star
"Shoot, brother! Kill Vaali now!",5 stars
Why hasn't Prince Ram taken the shot?,1 star
Sugreev is nearly dead!,1 star
My brother is hesitating.,3 stars
"Lord Ram, this is no time to hesitate.",5 stars
Please shoot the arrow.,1 star
"I cannot, Hanuman.",1 star
I cannot tell who is who.,1 star
They look exactly alike.,2 stars
"If I shoot, I might kill Sugreev.",3 stars
What are you doing?,5 stars
"It's over, Sugreev.",2 stars
I've taken back Kishkindha from you.,1 star
I've taken your wife from you.,5 stars
"And now finally,",5 stars
I will take your life from you!,5 stars
This is an age of darkness,5 stars
where horrors stalk the shadows,5 stars
of our lands.,5 stars
"For many, there is no hope that",3 stars
beauty will ever return to the forest.,5 stars
"Yet, beauty is not frail.",3 stars
Its strength can still be found.,4 stars
"Yet, there are divine beings",3 stars
still giving hope.,4 stars
But their light has become faint,3 stars
and may soon be extinguished forever.,2 stars
"Angad, I'm sorry.",2 stars
Angad?,3 stars
What?,1 star
"Something's disturbing you,",2 stars
my friend.,5 stars
"""My friend""?",3 stars
Who conspired to kill my father?,5 stars
Who brought outsiders into our home?,1 star
Who killed the rightful king,5 stars
through deceit?,1 star
"""My friend!""",5 stars
King Sugreev has given us,5 stars
an important mission.,5 stars
That must tell you,5 stars
how much he values you.,5 stars
Sugreev sent us on a mission,3 stars
doomed to fail.,1 star
Can't you see that?,3 stars
If we don't find Princess Sita,3 stars
"in a month, all our lives are forfeit.",1 star
Listen to Prince Angad.,5 stars
His words speak the truth.,5 stars
We have all been deceived,1 star
by King Sugreev.,5 stars
"Do you think he's right, brother?",3 stars
That this is a fool's quest?,1 star
Is that why Sugreev picked us?,3 stars
Give it!,5 stars
Give it!,5 stars
Mine!,5 stars
Hungry! Give me now.,5 stars
I'm sure Angad went this way.,3 stars
Are you sure?,3 stars
I don't want to get lost.,5 stars
What are they?,1 star
Fresh meat for us.,5 stars
I have never seen such a beast.,1 star
He chilled my blood.,1 star
We dare not attack.,1 star
Then what shall we do?,5 stars
They journey towards...,4 stars
We shall go to our queen.,5 stars
She will arrange,4 stars
an appropriate greeting.,4 stars
Look there.,5 stars
I was wondering,3 stars
if they would appear.,3 stars
"What are they, Jambhvan?",1 star
"These are the Vandevata,",5 stars
"spirits of the woods, Hanuman.",5 stars
And they seem drawn,4 stars
towards our prince.,5 stars
How have we never seen them before?,5 stars
So close to Kishkindha.,5 stars
"When I was much younger,",3 stars
they could be found,3 stars
in every part of this forest.,5 stars
They were magical times.,5 stars
"Now they are few. Exiled, hunted.",1 star
Who would commit such a crime?,1 star
The dark reflections.,5 stars
The rakshasas.,5 stars
The demons feed,5 stars
upon these gentle creatures.,5 stars
They need our help.,5 stars
That must be why,3 stars
they showed themselves to us.,5 stars
Where?,1 star
What a stench!,1 star
This must be the cave of some beast.,5 stars
No. Feel it. It's not stone.,1 star
It's bone.,3 stars
"This isn't a cave, Angad.",1 star
This is the remains of a beast.,5 stars
Look at the size of it.,3 stars
What could have killed it?,1 star
Listen.,1 star
Whatever it was. It's gone.,5 stars
For now.,5 stars
Let's find the others.,4 stars
The demon that did this,5 stars
is an abomination of this forest.,1 star
Then our duty is clear.,5 stars
We must find it and destroy it.,5 stars
Look over there.,1 star
That path was made by something big.,2 stars
"Come on, Hanuman.",5 stars
"Wait, Angad.",2 stars
We don't know what we're up against.,3 stars
"Wait? Since when are you scared,",1 star
my friend?,1 star
"We aren't here to hunt demons, Angad.",2 stars
Finding Princess Sita is our only mission.,4 stars
"If we do nothing, what happens",1 star
to the vanadevata? They'll be wiped out.,2 stars
"King Sugreev gave us a mission, Angad.",3 stars
"To uphold dharma,",5 stars
that is your mission.,3 stars
What you see as separate,5 stars
is all part of a single whole.,5 stars
The forces of adharma are rising.,2 stars
Only we can stop them.,3 stars
You and me,5 stars
on the same side for once.,2 stars
"I've always been on your side, Angad.",3 stars
"Stay close, brother.",5 stars
"Are you frightened, brother?",5 stars
No. Of course not.,1 star
Why? Are you?,1 star
Why should I be frightened?,1 star
We're just in a dark forest,3 stars
searching for a giant demon,4 stars
armed with little more,5 stars
than a stick and a toy.,2 stars
Perhaps the demon has run away?,3 stars
Of course! That's exactly what's happened.,5 stars
There is nothing to worry about.,2 stars
I bet the rakshas has run off,2 stars
and is far away from here.,5 stars
Lucky for the rakshas then.,5 stars
"If I had gotten my hands on it,",3 stars
"well, I would have torn it in two.",3 stars
I would have chopped it,2 stars
into pieces. Easy!,1 star
See this?,1 star
That's what I would have done.,3 stars
Snapped it into a dozen pieces.,1 star
"No, a hundred pieces.",1 star
Is that right? Can you even count that,1 star
high? Just a moment. I would've just...,2 stars
ripped it into...,1 star
"Nal, I'd stop that if I were you.",2 stars
"Once I start, there's no stopping me.",2 stars
"Help me! Help me, Nal!",5 stars
It's trying to eat me.,2 stars
"Help! Help, Hanuman!",5 stars
The forest is haunted! We must flee!,5 stars
"Hanuman, we have to go back",1 star
to Kishkindha. Immediately!,5 stars
"Sooner, if possible!",3 stars
What is this place?,5 stars
An encampment.,4 stars
Of the rakshasas.,5 stars
Looks like they've abandoned the place.,2 stars
But why?,3 stars
Let's clear out the biggest building.,5 stars
We'll all sleep in there tonight.,5 stars
"We'll take shifts on watch,",4 stars
just in case.,4 stars
You think they might come back?,1 star
It was here a moment ago.,5 stars
Where did it go?,1 star
What?,1 star
My silver armlet.,5 stars
My father gave it to me,5 stars
just before we left.,1 star
"I promised him I'd look after it,",3 stars
and now it's gone.,5 stars
Perhaps it fell off in the forest?,2 stars
"No, I removed it just a minute ago.",1 star
Hariya.,5 stars
Where is it?,1 star
Where is what?,1 star
You've been looking at it all day.,5 stars
I know you have it. Give it to me.,5 stars
You're mad!,5 stars
I have nothing of yours.,1 star
I know you took it.,5 stars
Why?,1 star
Leave my things alone.,1 star
- Leave it!,1 star
- Hey!,5 stars
You wretch!,5 stars
How dare you lay your hands,5 stars
on my belongings?,1 star
"Your father is a thief, not me.",1 star
Enough!,3 stars
We do not whip our own.,1 star
What's going on?,1 star
"Hariya has my armlet, Hanuman.",5 stars
It's my father's.,5 stars
He's a thief. He always has been!,5 stars
How many families did he steal from,5 stars
and ruin when he served Vaali?,1 star
The reign of Vaali is over.,2 stars
What happened then is the past.,5 stars
Well? Do you have the armlet?,3 stars
"No, my Lord. I swear it.",1 star
"Search my belongings,",5 stars
meagre as they are. You'll find nothing.,3 stars
I am your humble servant.,5 stars
Get up.,1 star
It's dark and easy to miss things.,4 stars
Tomorrow morning we'll search,5 stars
the camp properly.,5 stars
We'll find the armlet.,3 stars
Don't worry.,5 stars
"If you say so, Hanuman, but...",3 stars
We are all allies here.,5 stars
We need to trust one another.,5 stars
The fools.,5 stars
Hanuman will lead us all,5 stars
to our deaths.,5 stars
Who's there?,1 star
"Is that you, Nil?",1 star
"If it's you, Nil, I'll skin your hide!",1 star
This is not time for...,1 star
"Where are you, Hariya?",1 star
Where am I?,5 stars
Please let me go. Have mercy!,1 star
What are you and your people doing,5 stars
"in my forest, little monkey?",3 stars
"Tell me quickly. My subjects are hungry,",5 stars
and though you are scrawny...,3 stars
it has been many moons,3 stars
since they were fed.,3 stars
"Please, mighty lady,",5 stars
I am nothing. Less than nothing.,1 star
I am but a humble servant,4 stars
of King Sugreev.,5 stars
We stumbled into your forest,5 stars
"by accident, on a quest.",4 stars
A foolish quest to find,5 stars
Princess Sita...,3 stars
Sita? Sita!,1 star
Cursed is the name of Sita!,1 star
"Foolish vaanar, you have sealed your doom.",1 star
Please... Please!,1 star
I never wanted to go on this quest.,1 star
I hate Sita as much as you.,1 star
"Oh, you wretch!",1 star
Your hate for her cannot compare to mine.,1 star
Please! Let me prove it.,5 stars
Let me help you.,5 stars
Prove it? How?,1 star
Any way I can.,5 stars
"Just give me a chance, that is all I ask.",5 stars
"What do you want, great Queen?",5 stars
I want Ram to suffer,1 star
as I have suffered.,5 stars
I want him to feel as I feel.,5 stars
The agony of losing the thing one loves.,5 stars
The loss of Sita would destroy him.,2 stars
It would tear out his heart.,2 stars
Never speak that name in my presence,1 star
if you value your pitiful life.,1 star
"Yet, you speak the truth.",4 stars
Her loss would be the greatest suffering,1 star
for the Prince.,4 stars
You say you have been sent to find her?,1 star
"Yes, great one.",5 stars
"Since she was taken by Ravan,",4 stars
"Ram has known no happiness, no peace.",1 star
This army of vaanars is led,5 stars
"by Hanuman,",4 stars
who has sworn he will find Si...,3 stars
the Princess for him.,5 stars
Hanuman's devotion to Ram is without equal.,2 stars
He would rather die than fail him.,2 stars
Then we must kill this Hanuman.,5 stars
Tell me. Where is...,1 star
"Where are you, Hariya?",1 star
I know you have my armlet.,5 stars
What have you...,5 stars
done with it?,3 stars
"Help me destroy this Hanuman,",5 stars
snivelling worm.,4 stars
Do so and I shall be generous.,5 stars
Fail me and your death,1 star
will be preceded by much suffering.,3 stars
Swear to serve me,5 stars
"and you may yet live, little monkey.",5 stars
I swear to serve you.,5 stars
"I swear it, my Lady.",5 stars
My Lady?,1 star
I am Shurpanakha.,5 stars
Sister of the great Ravan.,5 stars
Shurpanakha.,3 stars
This is an age of monsters.,5 stars
As the great darkness spreads,5 stars
across the three realms...,5 stars
"rakshasas, long since hidden",1 star
"in the bowels of the Earth,",5 stars
came forth to rampage,1 star
across the kingdoms of man.,5 stars
Countless valiant kings fell,1 star
under the relentless armies,5 stars
of the rakshasas.,5 stars
The rakshasas were led under the banner,1 star
of a great and terrible master.,5 stars
A master who drowns,5 stars
the three realms in blood.,5 stars
In a sea of blood!,5 stars
We're almost there.,3 stars
Where is this place,5 stars
you're taking us to anyway?,1 star
Rishyamukh.,3 stars
An ashram where King Sugreev,4 stars
and the rest of us currently live.,5 stars
Wait.,1 star
We aren't going to Kishkindha?,1 star
I thought that was the home,3 stars
of the vaanars.,5 stars
We are not welcome,1 star
in Kishkindha anymore.,1 star
May I ask why?,3 stars
It is a long story.,4 stars
Then it is a good thing.,4 stars
We have a long walk ahead of us.,4 stars
It is better if you hear it,3 stars
in the presence of King Sugreev.,5 stars
Does Sugreev even have enough monkeys,3 stars
to properly search for Sita?,3 stars
"Patience, brother.",5 stars
"I'm just saying, this Sugreev",1 star
may not be as powerful as we...,3 stars
Quiet.,4 stars
Why have you stopped?,1 star
Be careful.,4 stars
Stop!,1 star
"Prince Ram, what are you doing?",5 stars
What needs to be done.,5 stars
We have to help him.,3 stars
Just wait. Trust him.,5 stars
Go in peace.,5 stars
You have nothing to fear from us.,5 stars
Neither of you do.,1 star
Look!,5 stars
Lord Ram... the child...,5 stars
How did you know?,5 stars
"I didn't at first, but it wouldn't have",3 stars
changed anything if I did.,1 star
That creature needed help.,4 stars
But the rakshasas are your enemy.,3 stars
"No one is my enemy, Hanuman.",5 stars
"Sometimes, we have no choice",3 stars
but to take a life.,3 stars
But to show mercy,3 stars
takes even greater strength.,5 stars
"When you kill,",5 stars
you steal from all who loved him,5 stars
and steal from everyone,1 star
he will ever love.,5 stars
"Now, let us continue to Rishyamukh.",5 stars
"My Lord, you asked me to discover",5 stars
the true nature of these strangers. I have.,5 stars
They are friends.,4 stars
Ayodhya's Prince Ram and Prince Lakshman,4 stars
can be trusted.,4 stars
That is not for you to decide.,2 stars
Not while I am your leader.,2 stars
"My Lord, I meant no disrespect,",5 stars
but they are good men.,3 stars
"Exiles, you mean!",1 star
They were banished,1 star
from the kingdom of Ayodhya.,5 stars
"I have heard of these names,",5 stars
Ram and Lakshman.,5 stars
"My Lord, they are vagabonds",1 star
with no allegiance to any man or king.,1 star
They cannot be trusted.,2 stars
"Hanuman is young, brash!",1 star
He is too easily taken in,2 stars
by fine words and friendly appearance.,4 stars
He does not know the ways of the world,2 stars
and thinks only with his mace.,2 stars
"Be careful, minister.",4 stars
"If I am as you say, you may not like",3 stars
the thoughts my mace has for you.,5 stars
Enough! We are not here,1 star
to argue amongst ourselves.,5 stars
I will hear what these humans,5 stars
have to say.,3 stars
What happened in the forest?,1 star
What do you mean?,1 star
There is something...,2 stars
"different about you, young Hanuman.",3 stars
I... There is.,3 stars
But I don't know what.,3 stars
Can you tell me?,5 stars
"In time, young Hanuman. In time.",5 stars
"Humans, why have you come to me?",1 star
"We have come for your help, great King.",5 stars
"My wife, Princess Sita, has been kidnapped.",4 stars
Your wife? By whom?,1 star
"A rakshas, a powerful one.",5 stars
She was carried away,1 star
in his aerial chariot.,5 stars
"We have searched the Dandaka Forest,",4 stars
but he has left no trail.,2 stars
"Having heard of your greatness,",5 stars
"we ask, humbly, for your aid.",5 stars
"You ask for much, Prince.",5 stars
But what do you offer in return?,3 stars
"I see no gold, or treasures, or gifts.",1 star
"Yet, you wish the great Sugreev",3 stars
to chase what? A cloud?,3 stars
I offer everything I have.,5 stars
Everything I am.,5 stars
"Blood, heart, strength...",5 stars
and friendship.,5 stars
Which I offer you forever.,5 stars
Friendship?,3 stars
Humans are always promising friendship.,5 stars
Where were such friends,5 stars
when I needed them?,3 stars
They have never given us a reason,1 star
to trust them.,5 stars
"You think too much of yourself, Ram.",2 stars
"""Prince Ram.""",5 stars
"Let him finish, my Lord.",5 stars
I believe Prince Ram can help us,5 stars
from the shadow that covers Rishyamukh.,5 stars
Vaali.,1 star
"Yes, my King. Vaali.",5 stars
"Be that as it may, answer me this.",5 stars
Why come to us for help?,3 stars
Have your own people,5 stars
turned their backs on you?,1 star
Let the humans help their own kind.,5 stars
"Like you, King Sugreev,",5 stars
we too are exiles from our true home.,5 stars
"And so, we cannot ask for help",2 stars
from the humans.,5 stars
"Only the fortitude, numbers",3 stars
"and the knowledge of this land,",5 stars
"which the vaanars possess,",5 stars
can aid us in our quest.,5 stars
"No, brother.",1 star
"With or without the vaanars help,",4 stars
"I promise you this, brother,",5 stars
"that, as long as I stand",3 stars
"by your side,",5 stars
we will finish our quest,5 stars
to find Sita.,4 stars
"Together, you and I.",5 stars
Ram and Lakshman.,5 stars
There was a time when my brother and I,4 stars
"were also so loyal, so inseparable.",1 star
But how quickly things can change.,3 stars
"Then tell me your story, King Sugreev.",5 stars
"Tell me of your brother, Vaali.",5 stars
"I was cast out by my own brother,",5 stars
who ruled Kishkindha with an iron fist.,5 stars
"Others, unable to live under his tyranny,",2 stars
joined me here upon the mountain.,5 stars
"Yet, there is not a night that passes when",3 stars
I do not dream of gaining all we have lost.,5 stars
There are those that will defy,2 stars
"even the greatest of monsters,",5 stars
until they become monsters themselves.,2 stars
So came the terrible Mayavi,1 star
to the kingdom of the vaanars.,5 stars
The rakshas had the blood,3 stars
of a dozen kings upon his claws.,5 stars
"Yet, his appetite for destruction",3 stars
remained undiminished.,1 star
The challenge was issued to the king,5 stars
"of the vaanars,",5 stars
"my brother, the great Vaali.",5 stars
Mayavi would test his strength,4 stars
against the famed king.,1 star
If Vaali lost...,2 stars
Mayavi would devour his people.,4 stars
The challenge was accepted.,4 stars
My brother wanted to protect us.,5 stars
He could not let Mayavi destroy,1 star
"the kingdom, our people.",5 stars
"What happened next, Your Majesty?",1 star
A battle unlike any one has ever seen.,5 stars
"The rakshas tore up mighty trees,",1 star
yet my brother swatted them aside,3 stars
as though they were stalks of wheat.,3 stars
"Mayavi hurled boulders at him,",1 star
but they shattered,3 stars
upon his shoulders like raindrops!,5 stars
I witnessed it all.,5 stars
How the earth shook.,5 stars
How the skies thundered,5 stars
and trembled with fear,1 star
at the duel between these titans.,5 stars
Then?,2 stars
A miracle!,5 stars
"The great and terrible Mayavi,",5 stars
"the conqueror of a dozen kingdoms,",5 stars
fled like a coward.,1 star
"My brother chased him,",5 stars
and I followed behind.,5 stars
"Eventually, Mayavi escaped underground,",1 star
hoping to hide from my brother's wrath.,5 stars
If only...,3 stars
if only we had turned back then,3 stars
and left Mayavi to cower,1 star
in the underworld.,5 stars
But no.,2 stars
"Vaali had won,",2 stars
but he could not leave it at that.,3 stars
I begged him not to go.,1 star
But he told me a true vaanar,3 stars
doesn't just protect his kingdom,3 stars
but must protect all kingdoms.,4 stars
Mayavi's evil needed to end.,3 stars
So my brother followed the rakshas,3 stars
into the darkness.,5 stars
I should have followed him,2 stars
"as you follow your brother,",5 stars
Prince Lakshman.,5 stars
Maybe together,3 stars
things would have been different.,3 stars
Vaali disappeared into the darkness.,1 star
Lord Sugreev was commanded,5 stars
"to stay and guard the entrance,",5 stars
in case Mayavi somehow found a way back.,3 stars
"Days turned to weeks,",2 stars
weeks to months,2 stars
"and months to years,",5 stars
but Vaali did not return.,1 star
We believed Vaali had perished,1 star
in the underground.,5 stars
He would never return.,1 star
"Yet, a kingdom cannot prosper",2 stars
without a king.,1 star
We had no idea that Vaali would return.,1 star
But what returned was not my brother.,2 stars
The darkness,5 stars
did something to him.,3 stars
Vaali blamed his brother for stealing,1 star
the crown and imprisoned him.,1 star
"So, Vaali took the crown",3 stars
and the throne.,5 stars
Then he took something...,2 stars
much more precious.,5 stars
He took your wife.,5 stars
Her name is Ruma.,3 stars
What kind of a man abandons his wife?,1 star
"You are not such a man, are you?",1 star
You would shake the world,5 stars
to find your beloved.,5 stars
Is that what I should have done?,3 stars
"I cannot answer for others, great King.",5 stars
Only myself.,1 star
Then believe me when I tell you,5 stars
I love my wife no less than you do yours.,5 stars
I am not fit to face her any more.,2 stars
I should have fought harder.,2 stars
You would have been killed,1 star
if you'd faced Vaali.,3 stars
Then where would we be?,1 star
"Living under the boot of a tyrant,",5 stars
"with no freedom, no hope.",1 star
A king must always protect his people.,5 stars
Despite the costs.,3 stars
Prince Ram can help us defeat Vaali,5 stars
and regain our true home.,5 stars
"Your memory is short, Hanuman.",2 stars
Vaali is too powerful.,2 stars
"If our King cannot beat him,",1 star
what hope do these two have?,5 stars
Look at them.,5 stars
They are not great warriors.,2 stars
What armour do they have?,4 stars
No shiny shields or deadly swords.,2 stars
Vaali's very step,4 stars
can make the forest shake.,4 stars
"With a clap of his hands,",1 star
he can blow down trees.,5 stars
How will you face such a being?,5 stars
You are neither gods nor saviours.,1 star
You are just what you appear to be.,5 stars
Humans.,3 stars
It's... it's coming back!,1 star
We'll be destroyed!,1 star
"No, not destroyed.",1 star
Enlightened.,5 stars
Ruma.,3 stars
You say there was no trail,1 star
for you to follow?,3 stars
Show them the jewellery.,5 stars
Maybe there was.,3 stars
"We will find our wives together,",5 stars
Prince Ram.,5 stars
This anklet belongs to Sita!,5 stars
She was wearing it,3 stars
when I saw her last!,5 stars
How did you get it?,5 stars
"I found it, young Prince.",5 stars
"I found the anklet upon a tree branch,",3 stars
after hearing what I thought,4 stars
was the cry of a bird,1 star
coming from the clouds.,5 stars
A cry?,1 star
Now I realize,5 stars
it must have been a woman's cry.,1 star
"If I had known whose it was, my Prince,",3 stars
perhaps your search would already be over.,3 stars
But the clouds are too high,3 stars
even for me.,5 stars
"You have given us hope, Hanuman,",5 stars
and we have had so little of that,2 stars
since Sita vanished.,2 stars
Thank you.,5 stars
Hanuman does not know who is responsible,3 stars
for kidnapping Princess Sita.,4 stars
He does not know whose Pushpak Viman it was,3 stars
that flew so high above the clouds.,1 star
But I do.,3 stars
This crime was not committed,1 star
"by a mere rakshas,",3 stars
"or a beast of the Dandaka Forest,",5 stars
but by the demon king himself.,3 stars
The greatest darkness,5 stars
the worlds have ever known.,5 stars
The one who has conquered the heavens,5 stars
and humbled the gods themselves.,5 stars
He's known by many names.,4 stars
"Lokvinashak, Dashaasan, Lankeshwar.",4 stars
Whose name is the very scream,1 star
that shakes the realms.,5 stars
That name is...,1 star
Ravan.,3 stars
A name. At last.,5 stars
Ravan.,3 stars
"Tell me of this Ravan, o great Sugreev.",5 stars
Tell me of the one I must destroy.,5 stars
"Though exiled in the forest,",3 stars
Ram's love for his wife was boundless,1 star
There was nothing,1 star
he would not do for her,2 stars
"So, when Princess Sita asked him",3 stars
"to get the beautiful golden deer for her,",5 stars
how could he refuse her?,1 star
She had never seen anything,1 star
so beautiful,5 stars
But Lakshman cautioned him,3 stars
that there was something unnatural,1 star
about the creature,4 stars
But Ram was determined,3 stars
to see his wife smile,4 stars
A small thank you for all the hardships,4 stars
she had endured in their exile,3 stars
He asked his brother,3 stars
to keep her safe,5 stars
Had Ram only listened,1 star
"to his brother that day,",5 stars
"had he not been led astray,",3 stars
"perhaps, then,",3 stars
this whole story would be different,3 stars
and Ram would have remained happy,3 stars
in the forest,5 stars
For Ram lost much that day,2 stars
"But in killing the demon Maricha,",3 stars
he was not the only one to suffer,1 star
"As he watched the demon die,",1 star
"mimicking screams in Ram's voice,",4 stars
he remembered,5 stars
"the words of his brother,",5 stars
"""Don't go, for I fear this is a trick",1 star
"that may destroy us.""",2 stars
"All right, big boy, shall we continue?",5 stars
It's over,2 stars
You're safe now,5 stars
I thought my life was over,2 stars
You risked your life for me. Thank you,5 stars
How could I do any less?,1 star
How did this happen?,1 star
I was kidnapped,1 star
Stolen from my home last night,1 star
"The demon said nothing,",1 star
gave me no reason,1 star
Strange,1 star
A rakshas like this rarely enters,1 star
a city alone,5 stars
"Tell me, who is your king?",5 stars
"It's my uncle, the great King Suketu",5 stars
I am sure his guards,3 stars
must be searching for me,5 stars
Suketu?,2 stars
Does King Suketu know this forest?,3 stars
We are on a mission and time's running out,4 stars
Maybe he can help us?,3 stars
Why not? You people saved my life,1 star
My uncle has vast resources,5 stars
"If you take me to him,",3 stars
I'm sure he will reward you,4 stars
I like the sound of this reward,5 stars
Maybe it's food,3 stars
"If it is, I think I'll like the taste of it",3 stars
even more,5 stars
"Hanuman, a moment",4 stars
See how they talk behind your back?,3 stars
You are the prince!,5 stars
Does Hanuman think he's better than you?,3 stars
"Quiet, Hariya",5 stars
My head is pounding for some reason,3 stars
and your voice only makes it worse,2 stars
Some more water then,3 stars
to ease your headache,4 stars
I know of Suketu. He is a good man,4 stars
"I feel there is a ""but"" coming",3 stars
But he may not be the ally,3 stars
we think,5 stars
There is a darker history,3 stars
that may surprise you,3 stars
Enough of your whispering!,5 stars
Suketu knew my father,5 stars
They were allies and friends,5 stars
Someone has to think of our mission,4 stars
Someone has to lead,1 star
If we are to hold this girl's hands,3 stars
"all the way home,",5 stars
then at least we can get some help,3 stars
from a friendly face,5 stars
Angad is wise. We must listen to him,5 stars
"Unless you think otherwise, Hanuman",3 stars
"Jambhvan, this is the best choice we have",5 stars
Let's head to the Yaksh Kingdom,5 stars
We're almost there. Come on,4 stars
Last one there has to rub Jambhvan's feet!,5 stars
Not after last time!,1 star
I nearly passed out!,1 star
"This time it'll be you, Nal!",5 stars
Look at them,5 stars
To be young,3 stars
"Angad, are you all right?",3 stars
I'm fine. Take care of yourself,4 stars
Help! Help!,1 star
Now what?,1 star
"Nal, what happened?",1 star
Why did you scream?,1 star
What is this?,5 stars
Have you ever seen anything,5 stars
"like it before, Jambhvan?",4 stars
Never and that's what worries me,5 stars
These vines were not here yesterday,1 star
What has happened to my kingdom?,5 stars
My King?,1 star
Don't touch it,1 star
It might be poisonous,2 stars
Look! Angad's just ripping them apart,1 star
"See, they're just vines,",2 stars
easily pushed aside,1 star
We should wait,3 stars
You can hide outside if you wish,3 stars
I will follow the Prince,5 stars
"There are darker forces at work here,",3 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
"Perhaps, old bear. But if so,",3 stars
we can't let them face it alone,5 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
Where is everyone?,1 star
There!,5 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
"Nirvani, where were you?",1 star
We were so worried!,1 star
Who... who are these vaanars?,1 star
Don't worry; they're friends,4 stars
They saved me from a rakshas,5 stars
in the forest,5 stars
What happened here?,1 star
How did these vines surround the city?,1 star
No one knows. They grew overnight,5 stars
King Suketu is planning to use all his power,5 stars
to perform a mahayagna to destroy this evil,5 stars
Take us to him,5 stars
I must speak with my uncle at once,5 stars
Uncle Suketu!,5 stars
Nirvani! Thank the gods you're safe,5 stars
We searched the city but feared the worst,2 stars
when you went missing,5 stars
I would have died,1 star
if it wasn't for these heroes,2 stars
They killed the rakshas,5 stars
that took me,3 stars
These are the vaanars of Kishkindha,1 star
"I present to you Hanuman,",5 stars
Jambhvan and Prince Angad,4 stars
It is an honour to welcome you,5 stars
"to my kingdom, Prince Angad",5 stars
"But tell me,",3 stars
how did you get past these vines?,5 stars
What do you mean? I just pulled them apart,1 star
They're just vines,2 stars
"Impossible! We've tried cutting them,",1 star
"burning them,",1 star
"even using magic, but nothing works",1 star
They surround the entire kingdom now,5 stars
"Wait, if they surround your entire kingdom",2 stars
then that means...,3 stars
Yes. I'm afraid there's no way in or out,3 stars
You're as trapped here as we are,5 stars
Trapped? No!,1 star
We must leave at once!,1 star
"We're on an urgent mission,",5 stars
and its success grows slimmer,2 stars
with every setting sun!,5 stars
But that's not for me,3 stars
but for our great leader to decide,4 stars
"Isn't it, friend?",1 star
I see much has changed in Kishkindha,3 stars
I was sorry to hear,1 star
about your father's death,4 stars
It wasn't right,2 stars
what Sugreev did to him,5 stars
"Thank you,",5 stars
but Sugreev is our king now,4 stars
"If we don't do his bidding,",2 stars
our lives are forfeit,1 star
I need your help,5 stars
Then you will have it,4 stars
"For saving Nirvani,",4 stars
all my resources are yours,5 stars
"But, first, we must destroy these vines",3 stars
"Prince Angad,",5 stars
the vines opened for you before,1 star
Perhaps you possess something,2 stars
that we do not,1 star
Perhaps he does,3 stars
What? This worked earlier!,1 star
Why won't you move?,1 star
#NAME?,4 stars
"- Be quiet, old bear!",5 stars
"Perhaps you should resume your mahayagna,",3 stars
Lord Suketu,5 stars
Surely this barrier would be no match,2 stars
for your immense power,5 stars
"Whatever we do, it needs to be fast",4 stars
"If we fail, Lord Suketu will not be there",1 star
to stop Sugreev's sword,5 stars
when he swings it down on our necks!,2 stars
"Angad, we do this mission to help",3 stars
"Prince Ram, not for fear of death",1 star
I have faith,5 stars
Prince Ram will guide us,5 stars
You come as envoys of Ram?,1 star
Ram of Ayodhya?,1 star
Do you represent Ram of Ayodhya?,1 star
Speak!,5 stars
"Yes, Lord Suketu",5 stars
We've been sent on this mission,5 stars
to honour an oath made by King Sugreev,5 stars
"to Prince Ram,",5 stars
"to find his wife, Princess Sita",4 stars
Cursed be his name,1 star
Ram and his brother,4 stars
took everything from me,1 star
"My beautiful daughter, Tataka,",5 stars
"and my loving grandson, Maricha",5 stars
Tataka's foolish husband,1 star
mocked Sage Agastya,5 stars
and was killed for his mistake,1 star
It should have ended there,1 star
But the sage spared no one,1 star
My daughter and grandson,5 stars
"were also cursed,",1 star
"robbed of their true appearance,",5 stars
"transformed into monsters, into rakshasas",5 stars
"Driven mad by their transformation,",1 star
their minds became twisted,2 stars
until nothing of my sweet daughter,1 star
and her son remained,5 stars
They terrorized the holy men,1 star
"of the forest, attacking them,",5 stars
destroying their homes,1 star
and fouling their yagnas,1 star
"Eventually, Sage Vishwamitra appealed",3 stars
to Ayodhya's king,5 stars
who sent two warriors,1 star
"They first killed my sweet daughter, Tataka",5 stars
"Then later, when my grandson, Maricha,",3 stars
was tricked by Ravan,1 star
"into posing as a beautiful golden deer,",5 stars
they killed him as well,1 star
"That arrow did not just kill him,",3 stars
it killed my spirit,1 star
Those two warriors,1 star
"were Princes Ram and Lakshman,",5 stars
sons of Dashrath of Ayodhya,5 stars
I would rather die,2 stars
with all of us trapped inside these vines,5 stars
than see you leave here and help Ram!,5 stars
"Uncle, you can't do this!",1 star
We will starve!,1 star
The vaanars will starve,1 star
before our people will,5 stars
"Once they are dead, I will resume",4 stars
my mahayagna and remove the vines,5 stars
"King Suketu, you're wrong about Prince Ram",5 stars
He is a man whose virtue and righteousness,5 stars
have given my life a greater meaning,5 stars
There is a great evil,5 stars
spreading across the realms,5 stars
These vines are just the start,5 stars
I believe Prince Ram may be the only one,1 star
that saves us in the end,4 stars
Ram and his brother robbed me,5 stars
of all that I loved in life,5 stars
Every day since has been one,5 stars
of hollow existence,1 star
Let the evil come. What can it do to me,5 stars
that hasn't already been done?,2 stars
"I'm sorry, my friends",1 star
I was not expecting to bring you,2 stars
into this... trap,1 star
"You did nothing wrong, Nirvani",5 stars
You will release me!,1 star
Release me!,1 star
"Angad, control yourself",5 stars
"Angad, are you...",2 stars
Don't touch me!,1 star
"Here, Prince Angad, relax a little",4 stars
Have some more water,3 stars
These vines are as strong as steel,5 stars
and as sharp as knives,5 stars
It's almost like it let us inside,3 stars
Suketu's kingdom,5 stars
with the intent to trap us inside,4 stars
"Yes, I thought that, too",3 stars
We must discover what this is,5 stars
and what its connection to Angad is,5 stars
Put out the fire,5 stars
There will be no yagna,1 star
"Tell the priests, if any of them",1 star
"say a prayer against these vines,",5 stars
they will face my punishment,5 stars
Hanuman saved my life,5 stars
How can you do this to him?,5 stars
"To our people, to me?",1 star
How dare you question me,5 stars
You know nothing of the pain,1 star
I have endured,5 stars
My daughter,5 stars
My grandson,5 stars
Dead because of Ram,1 star
"Tataka was my cousin, my sister",5 stars
Maricha was like my own son,5 stars
"They were my family, too, Uncle!",5 stars
But they were already dead and gone,2 stars
the moment Sage Agastya cursed them,5 stars
Ram killed only their bodies,1 star
He gave them salvation,5 stars
"I will never forgive him,",5 stars
never help him,1 star
Then help yourself,5 stars
To forgive is to set a prisoner free,1 star
"and discover, in the end,",5 stars
that the prisoner was you,5 stars
"Nirvani! I'm sorry,",1 star
but I will not help them,2 stars
"Then, I will",3 stars
What was that?,1 star
"It's the vines, Nal",5 stars
"Go, deal with it. Go on!",5 stars
Why me? You are the older one,1 star
But Mother loves me best,4 stars
"If anything happens to me,",3 stars
she'll be really upset,2 stars
You on the other hand?,3 stars
Not so much. Weren't you adopted? Go!,2 stars
Don't worry,5 stars
Remember your courage,5 stars
Remember why we are here,5 stars
Why do you keep us here?,1 star
Whom do you serve?,5 stars
"So, you're the little monkey",3 stars
that's caused all this trouble,1 star
Hardly even worth it,2 stars
How can you know my worth?,5 stars
You cannot see into my heart or soul,5 stars
"Do you challenge me, monkey?",3 stars
Do you wish to have your worth measured?,3 stars
"If the reward is freedom, then yes",3 stars
I am not afraid. Are you?,1 star
You are an insolent one,1 star
I see now why my mistress hates you so,5 stars
Fine. A game then,4 stars
Mistress?,1 star
It's unfair to play against one,1 star
that I can't see,3 stars
Show yourself,5 stars
and stop hiding behind those vines,1 star
"Careful, Hanuman!",5 stars
We don't know what we're up against,3 stars
"Stand back, Hanuman!",5 stars
I will face this demon,5 stars
"Oh, quiet, you fool",5 stars
You've done enough,3 stars
The grown-ups are now talking,4 stars
Lie down,1 star
Leave him alone!,1 star
Then come forward,4 stars
"You wanted to see the real me,",5 stars
didn't you?,1 star
"Hanuman, wait!",1 star
I'm coming with you,5 stars
"No, Jambhvan!",2 stars
"Listen to me. If this doesn't work,",1 star
you have to convince Suketu,3 stars
to complete the mahayagna,5 stars
You and Angad must still find Princess Sita,4 stars
"If I play your game and win,",5 stars
will you let these people go free?,1 star
Of course,3 stars
Do you want me to give you my word?,1 star
We both know that's worth nothing,1 star
TRUE,5 stars
"But then again,",3 stars
what other choice do you have?,5 stars
"So, do you accept my challenge, hero?",3 stars
"Hanuman, please",5 stars
We'll find another way,3 stars
That mace won't protect you in there,1 star
"I am more than my mace, my friend",5 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
Hanuman!,5 stars
"Jambhvan, quick!",5 stars
Something's wrong with Angad!,1 star
"Angad, are you all right?",3 stars
I don't think he is!,2 stars
"Angad, what's happened to you?",3 stars
You will all die,5 stars
You will all die!,5 stars
Though the two Princes had been led astray,3 stars
"by Ravan's cunning,",4 stars
the abduction of Princess Sita,4 stars
did not pass unnoticed,1 star
Nor unopposed,1 star
The noble Jatayu had witnessed the crime,3 stars
and came swiftly to the Princess's aid,5 stars
"Few creatures alive could defy him,",2 stars
and his wrath was terrible to behold,1 star
There was no foe,1 star
he had not overcome,3 stars
"But, until that grim day,",3 stars
he had never faced Ravan,1 star
And Jatayu's bravery,5 stars
came to an end,1 star
Or so it would seem,3 stars
"Wounded, dying, he lived long enough",1 star
to pass on what had happened,1 star
"So, even with his last breath,",3 stars
he gave the two Princes hope,4 stars
And was thus rewarded,5 stars
by the gods,5 stars
And the quest to save,5 stars
the Princess began,4 stars
Jatayu!,1 star
No!,1 star
Brother!,5 stars
Come on,5 stars
My leg!,5 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
Help your brother up,5 stars
Jatayu! Jatayu!,1 star
Jatayu!,1 star
Nal!,1 star
"Now, that's not something you see",3 stars
every day,5 stars
Stop! Stop! I want to get off!,1 star
"Do something, Nal!",1 star
Stop him!,1 star
Let my brother go!,5 stars
I've got this,5 stars
Hanuman! Wait! Wait!,1 star
Nal!,1 star
Brother!,5 stars
"Wait for me, Hanuman!",1 star
Let me help!,5 stars
Whoa!,5 stars
Nal! Nal! Where's Nal?,1 star
No need to thank me,5 stars
"Where are you, brother?",1 star
Nal!,1 star
I'm here!,5 stars
I landed on Jambhvan,1 star
Your belly is great for breaking falls,5 stars
Go help Hanuman,5 stars
Help him?,1 star
Does he look like he needs help?,3 stars
You misunderstand,3 stars
Go help stop him!,1 star
He doesn't know who he's fighting,3 stars
"Time to be rid of you, monster",5 stars
"Hanuman, child of the wind",5 stars
Child of the wind,5 stars
Who's there? Show yourself,5 stars
Show yourself!,5 stars
What...,1 star
What have you done to my brother?,5 stars
Tell me!,5 stars
Tell me!,5 stars
Are you done?,1 star
Now it's my turn,5 stars
"Stop, Hanuman. Stop",1 star
He's an ally,4 stars
"Unhand me, Angad! He's about to...",2 stars
"Great Sampati, hold back your anger",5 stars
Do you recognize me?,1 star
"I knew your brother, the noble Jatayu",5 stars
Jambhvan? Is that you?,1 star
Your fur has turned grey,1 star
"As have your feathers, old friend",5 stars
Forgive the over-enthusiasm,1 star
of these young ones,5 stars
We mean no harm,5 stars
This is Jatayu's brother?,1 star
Older,3 stars
"Please, please forgive me, Lord",1 star
I did not know,2 stars
"What's going on, Jambhvan?",1 star
Why are you here?,1 star
We need to talk,5 stars
I have grim news to tell you,5 stars
That cannot be true,1 star
"My heart breaks for your loss,",1 star
"great one, but it is true",4 stars
"Ravan slew your brother,",1 star
the noble Jatayu,5 stars
Mercilessly cut him down,1 star
as he tried to save Princess Sita,4 stars
"He died bravely,",5 stars
but the powers of Ravan...,3 stars
Ravan,3 stars
Ravan!,5 stars
Ravan!,5 stars
Ravan!,5 stars
#NAME?,5 stars
#NAME?,1 star
"But he is in pain, Jambhvan",3 stars
"Yes. Yes, he is",5 stars
And there is nothing,1 star
we can do about it,3 stars
Ravan!,5 stars
Ravan!,5 stars
Ravan!,5 stars
Jatayu,3 stars
My brother,5 stars
My brother was always too bold,3 stars
"And this time,",5 stars
I wasn't there to save him,1 star
"Too bold, by far",2 stars
Always trying,5 stars
to achieve the impossible,5 stars
Always challenging me,5 stars
But that is the way,3 stars
of younger brothers,3 stars
Their love is often expressed,4 stars
in rivalry,5 stars
"So, it was that day my brother",3 stars
challenged me to fly towards the sun,5 stars
"He was too stubborn and I couldn't say no,",2 stars
so I flew with him to keep an eye on him,3 stars
I used my wings to shade my brother,5 stars
from the sun,5 stars
Long enough for him to recover,2 stars
his strength and fly to safety,5 stars
Though the price was high,3 stars
A price I'd pay happily,5 stars
again and again,5 stars
"I couldn't save him,",1 star
but I can avenge him,3 stars
But how?,3 stars
"I am a cripple, stranded on a beach",1 star
I cannot help myself,1 star
How can I avenge my brother?,5 stars
How can I make Ravan feel my pain?,1 star
"Ravan will pay for his crimes, my Lord",5 stars
He will pay for them all,5 stars
"I serve King Sugreev,",5 stars
and he is allied to the noble Prince Ram,5 stars
"of Ayodhya and his brother, Prince Lakshman",5 stars
The two Princes are unlike,2 stars
any other mortals,1 star
"Ravan has escaped justice too long,",1 star
but he will not escape them,3 stars
They sent you here? Why?,1 star
"Prince Ram sent me here to find his wife,",5 stars
"Princess Sita,",5 stars
the woman your brother tried to save,5 stars
"We have journeyed far from our homes,",5 stars
and yet found no trace of her,3 stars
I fear we have failed,1 star
Too much time has passed,2 stars
We were supposed to find her by now,3 stars
If we just had a clue,3 stars
"to where she may be,",3 stars
then our delay would be,2 stars
of no consequence,1 star
"I have failed,",1 star
and now all our lives are forfeit,1 star
Their faith in me,5 stars
has been sorely misplaced,1 star
You have looked everywhere,5 stars
for Princess Sita?,3 stars
"Every patch of land south of Kishkindha,",5 stars
where Ravan was seen heading,3 stars
after abducting Princess Sita,4 stars
The land...,5 stars
but not the sea?,3 stars
Have you looked there?,1 star
No. Not the sea,1 star
No one can search the entire sea,1 star
I can,5 stars
"Despite my age,",3 stars
"I have few blessings, vaanar",3 stars
And my vision is one,5 stars
I am far-sighted,3 stars
My eyes can see,5 stars
"further than the moon,",5 stars
past the blinding sun,5 stars
and every hidden star,5 stars
in the universe,5 stars
"What do you see, my Lord?",5 stars
I see shining waves,3 stars
I see swift free-jumping creatures,3 stars
of pure joy,5 stars
I see the elements at war,3 stars
I see terror,1 star
What else?,1 star
I... I see a city,5 stars
A beautiful city. Richer than the wealth,5 stars
of a thousand nations,5 stars
"What else, Sampati? What else?",1 star
I see a woman,1 star
gazing into the still waters of a pond,4 stars
with sadness in her eyes,2 stars
Sad eyes? Did you say sad?,1 star
"Is it Princess Sita, Sampati?",1 star
She... she...,3 stars
She could be no one else,1 star
Princess Sita? Are you sure?,3 stars
She is in Lanka,3 stars
Lanka,4 stars
Princess Sita has been found!,5 stars
The Princess has been found!,4 stars
The Princess has been found!,4 stars
She's in Lanka!,5 stars
Lanka! Lanka! The Princess is in Lanka!,5 stars
Let's go to Lanka! Lanka!,5 stars
Hold on. Where's Lanka?,3 stars
Across the sea,5 stars
Across the sea? Then our quest is over,2 stars
The Princess cannot be reached,1 star
We have failed,1 star
King Sugreev will punish us,5 stars
Lord Sampati!,5 stars
Are you all right?,5 stars
"So very tired and so very alone,",1 star
my brother,5 stars
You have our company now,5 stars
You have done us a great service,5 stars
We'll look after you,5 stars
There's no need for that,3 stars
Let me just rest for a while,3 stars
"Somewhere peaceful, with a breeze",4 stars
The breeze reminds me of flying,5 stars
Flying in the endless skies,5 stars
"Flying without a care,",4 stars
flying alongside my brother,5 stars
I tell you we are doomed!,1 star
We need to turn back and throw ourselves,1 star
at the mercy of our king!,5 stars
Perhaps he'll forgive us,3 stars
"We tried our best, didn't we?",5 stars
We've done all anyone could ask for. We...,5 stars
Hey!,5 stars
"What sort of talk is this? What are you,",1 star
man or monkey? You can't give up now!,5 stars
"Get away from me, you buffoon!",1 star
Watch it! You can't go around,5 stars
calling my brother a buffoon!,1 star
Only I'm allowed to do that,3 stars
"Now, I want you to...",5 stars
Get away!,1 star
That is enough!,3 stars
"Now, who else thinks we're doomed?",1 star
This is your one and only chance,5 stars
I thought as much,3 stars
"Now listen, we have work to do",5 stars
What?,1 star
Who's there?,1 star
Foolish old bird,1 star
You're imagining things,5 stars
Jatayu?,1 star
You have returned!,1 star
They said that you...,1 star
I understand,5 stars
You have come for me,5 stars
I have waited so long,5 stars
for this moment,5 stars
And it has come as a gentle breeze,5 stars
"I cannot reach you, Jatayu",1 star
You are too high,2 stars
Go on... without me,3 stars
"Brother! Look, brother!",5 stars
Let us fly together again,5 stars
Let us take to the open skies,5 stars
Let us fly forever,5 stars
Forever,5 stars
I managed to talk some sense,3 stars
back into them,5 stars
"Now, before they change their minds again,",4 stars
we need to find a way to reach Lanka,4 stars
Perhaps we could have Sampati search Lanka,3 stars
more thoroughly and find...,5 stars
"He's gone. Disappeared, but to where?",1 star
He's where he should be,5 stars
In the open sky,5 stars
Like a bird always soaring,5 stars
"towards the heavens,",5 stars
"he, too, has taken flight once more",1 star
to fly alongside his brother,5 stars
He is finally free,5 stars
Hanuman's destiny was entwined,5 stars
with the Princes of Ayodhya,5 stars
from before he was born,5 stars
And how the gods blessed a royal family,5 stars
with the greatest of heroes!,5 stars
"Though a great king, blessed with riches",4 stars
"beyond measure and a loving people,",5 stars
King Dashrath lacked the one treasure,2 stars
all kings desire,5 stars
Children,4 stars
"After performing a great sacrifice,",5 stars
"the gods blessed him with a gift,",5 stars
a bowl of divine rice pudding,5 stars
"By consuming the rice pudding,",4 stars
the queens would become mothers of legends,5 stars
Each was given a portion,3 stars
appropriate to her rank,4 stars
"Half went to Queen Kaushalya,",2 stars
the eldest,5 stars
Then a quarter to Sumitra,2 stars
and an eighth to Kaikeyi,5 stars
The last portion,3 stars
was given again to Sumitra,3 stars
"But not before a small bird,",3 stars
"drawn by the sweet smell of the pudding,",4 stars
snatched a portion for itself,1 star
"And beak-full of rice pudding,",4 stars
it flew away,1 star
"Seeing drops falling,",2 stars
"the wind god, Vayu, carried them away",1 star
across the land towards noble Anjana,5 stars
Destined to be the mother,3 stars
of Hanuman,5 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
My son,5 stars
"If you are my father, then please...",3 stars
Please help me,3 stars
Ask what you wish,5 stars
There can be no more secrets,5 stars
Then who am I? What am I?,1 star
Come. Let me show you,5 stars
"Brother, where are you? Nal!",1 star
I told you to stay close,1 star
I'm right here,5 stars
Jambhvan?,2 stars
Are you hurt?,1 star
"I'm not so fragile, Angad",3 stars
Did you know,3 stars
the truth about Hanuman?,1 star
Then why didn't you tell him?,1 star
"Tell me, Angad",3 stars
"Having just witnessed all this,",5 stars
what is your first impression?,3 stars
I don't know,2 stars
It's all so unbelievable,1 star
There you have it,5 stars
Hanuman would never have believed me,1 star
if I'd merely told him,2 stars
Some truths must be revealed,3 stars
in their entirety,5 stars
Let us hope Hanuman can accept them,5 stars
I will answer the question,5 stars
uppermost in your mind first,5 stars
Why? Why was your true nature hidden,1 star
from you?,1 star
Though you already know the answer,3 stars
I was not ready. That I should first enjoy,2 stars
what it is to be... to be...,5 stars
"To be mortal, Hanuman",1 star
"Mortality is a gift,",5 stars
one we gods envy,5 stars
"To know the passing of days,",4 stars
"brief though it is,",3 stars
makes them all the more precious,5 stars
Unlimited life and power,5 stars
can lead to great pain,5 stars
A pain you can no longer feel yourself,1 star
"So, you end up inflicting it",3 stars
on all others,5 stars
Ravan,3 stars
"Ravan's gifts are countless,",2 stars
but he serves only himself,3 stars
"If you too fell to evil,",1 star
the three realms would shake,3 stars
to their very foundations,5 stars
"Without wisdom,",1 star
such power could have made you a paragon,5 stars
of terror,1 star
A tyrant to your own people,1 star
A god of destruction,5 stars
You could have been the hurricane,3 stars
"that extinguishes all light from the world,",5 stars
plunging us into eternal darkness,5 stars
No. I would never become,1 star
such a monster,5 stars
Why do you show me such things?,1 star
"I show you nothing, my son, except",1 star
what could be if you are not careful,3 stars
The choice against darkness,5 stars
is always yours,5 stars
How... how do I avoid such a fate?,1 star
"Use your powers,",5 stars
"your strength, all your gifts",5 stars
"to only serve others,",1 star
never to force others to serve you,5 stars
As Prince Ram does,5 stars
"Yes, my son",5 stars
Just as Prince Ram does,5 stars
"The universe strives for balance,",4 stars
"and so, for all of Ravan's evil,",5 stars
there is perfect opposition in Ram,5 stars
"Yet, without you, he is doomed to fail",1 star
It is your strength that must support him,5 stars
when the time comes,5 stars
If you should falter...,3 stars
then all hope is lost,1 star
"I will not falter, Father",5 stars
I will serve the Prince,5 stars
with my last breath,5 stars
So be it,5 stars
From now on...,5 stars
embrace your destiny,5 stars
"Arise, son of the wind",5 stars
Not that one,1 star
The one on the right,3 stars
"No, not my right, you fool",1 star
Your right,5 stars
"You fool, that's your left hand",1 star
Why won't you... Your right hand,1 star
The hand you use to eat,5 stars
Stop with the left and right!,1 star
Just make sure you catch it,4 stars
Who is shaking the tree?,1 star
Nal!,1 star
Look out!,1 star
Have you put on weight?,3 stars
That wasn't me. That was...,1 star
"Who shook the tree, you?",1 star
Not me,1 star
Him,5 stars
Hanuman?,1 star
Hanuman?,1 star
"Yes, old bear",5 stars
Hanuman. Son of the wind,5 stars
"Perhaps, for the first time,",3 stars
I am truly Hanuman,5 stars
What do you think?,5 stars
You look different,3 stars
Have you done something with your hair?,2 stars
"It's not his hair, fool!",1 star
He's got swagger now!,5 stars
Something like that,3 stars
How do you feel?,5 stars
I understand the temptation,5 stars
Ravan must face with such power,5 stars
"Thank you, Jambhvan. Without you...",5 stars
"without Prince Ram,",5 stars
I could never have been ready,1 star
"Don't thank me yet, my friend",1 star
Because your greatest challenge,5 stars
still lies ahead,3 stars
The sea is home to creatures,4 stars
that prey upon the unwary,5 stars
Creatures that,5 stars
the gods themselves fear,1 star
"And what of Lanka, good bear?",5 stars
"It is a city of wonder,",5 stars
mystery and danger,5 stars
What else would you expect,5 stars
from the kingdom of Ravan?,1 star
And its demonic inhabitants,5 stars
are unlike the brutes and outcasts,2 stars
you have faced so far,5 stars
Lanka is home to the greatest,5 stars
of all demonkind on Earth,5 stars
Ravan's warriors have conquered,5 stars
the heavens,5 stars
Each one armed with powerful weapons,5 stars
"and where their skill as warriors may fail,",5 stars
their dark magic prevails,4 stars
That and more lie ahead,3 stars
Dangers that would make,2 stars
even the bravest pause,5 stars
Not Hanuman! Just look at him,1 star
Look at how he's changed,3 stars
Apart from the hair!,1 star
Do you think a few mangy rakshasas,3 stars
are going to stop Hanuman?,1 star
He'll crush them all!,5 stars
Won't you?,1 star
"Let's find Princess Sita first, yes?",3 stars
But how? The sea looks endless,2 stars
Just looking at that makes my knees ache,3 stars
But my knees should be just fine,3 stars
What? Impossible,1 star
Yesterday perhaps,3 stars
"Today, everything seems possible",5 stars
I don't think that rock's ever coming down,2 stars
Hanuman! Hanuman!,5 stars
Hanuman! Hanuman!,5 stars
Hanuman! Hanuman!,5 stars
What's happening?,1 star
Someone is making mischief,1 star
And I think I know who,5 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
It's Hanuman?,1 star
What's happening to him?,1 star
He has finally seen for himself the,5 stars
very thing I saw in him when we first met,5 stars
Seen what?,1 star
The truth,5 stars
And that is something,3 stars
few of us ever discover,1 star
"For some, such knowledge can destroy them",3 stars
"But for others,",3 stars
there is no limit,1 star
to what they become capable of,5 stars
"Tell me, brother,",5 stars
did you ever have any doubt?,5 stars
In Hanuman? Never,1 star
Lanka,4 stars
Lanka,4 stars
It's not that far,3 stars
Just a hundred miles away,5 stars
Think you can do it?,3 stars
"Only one way to find out, old bear",3 stars
Though it might help,3 stars
to get a little extra height,4 stars
"Good luck, Hanuman! If you see any",5 stars
"rakshasas, give them a punch from us!",1 star
Yes. And that goes double for Ravan!,5 stars
Teach him what happens when he meddles,4 stars
with the vaanar!,5 stars
I'll do what I can,5 stars
Hanuman! Hanuman!,5 stars
My Lord!,5 stars
My Lord!,5 stars
No!,1 star
"My Lord, someone approaches",5 stars
Have the gods regained their courage,5 stars
at last?,3 stars
Who?,1 star
Indra? Agni?,2 stars
"No, not a god, my Lord",1 star
This is a creature unfamiliar to us,1 star
He rides the howling winds,4 stars
At last!,5 stars
A challenger,5 stars
I am eager to meet him,4 stars
Careful!,5 stars
You be careful. You're lucky,5 stars
I didn't smash your skull.,1 star
"Easy, Angad. I saw you were awake",3 stars
and brought you some food.,5 stars
I'm not hungry.,2 stars
And I can't sleep.,5 stars
It's this place.,5 stars
"You can almost smell it,",3 stars
taste it. The bitterness.,5 stars
The hate. It poisons the air.,1 star
You're letting this camp get to you.,5 stars
Don't let the evils of what we've seen,5 stars
darken your heart.,5 stars
"If we are loyal to each other,",3 stars
we will succeed.,5 stars
"Like you were loyal to my father,",5 stars
Hanuman?,1 star
Who are you to lecture me on loyalty?,5 stars
What Ram did to him...,5 stars
"Lord Ram is not the man you think, Angad.",2 stars
There is a purity in him,5 stars
that I have never found before.,5 stars
He didn't kill your father.,5 stars
He saved him,5 stars
from turning into something...,1 star
Enough! I'm done hearing about Ram.,4 stars
I came up here to be alone.,5 stars
Move!,5 stars
Wake up! All of you wake up!,5 stars
We're under attack!,1 star
Come on!,5 stars
We need to give the others time!,5 stars
But you're unarmed.,3 stars
I'll manage!,4 stars
You're not stealing all the fun.,1 star
"Wake up! All of you, wake up!",5 stars
Hanuman!,5 stars
Hanuman!,5 stars
The vaanars should have been,3 stars
ripped apart by now.,1 star
Who is this Hanuman?,1 star
"He is just a fool, great Lady.",5 stars
"Yes, he is strong,",5 stars
but his heart is his weakness.,3 stars
He cares too much,2 stars
for those around him.,4 stars
Then I will kill his friends,5 stars
to crush his spirit.,5 stars
"Then, I will crush his bones.",3 stars
And then...,2 stars
Go quickly. Bring my pet.,5 stars
Tell him Shurpanakha has need of him.,3 stars
Go.,5 stars
"Great one, I only ask that you spare",5 stars
the life of Prince Angad.,5 stars
Why should I spare him?,1 star
Or you?,1 star
"With Hanuman and his followers dead,",5 stars
Angad can take back the throne,2 stars
from Sugreev.,5 stars
And why should I care,5 stars
who sits on the vaanar throne?,1 star
Because I will become,5 stars
"Angad's most trusted advisor,",5 stars
but secretly your humble servant.,4 stars
And then I will bring you Ram,5 stars
and Lakshman in chains.,5 stars
Angad hates them.,1 star
"Let him kill Lakshman, then.",1 star
I want only Ram.,1 star
"A deal, then. Hanuman dies",4 stars
and will never find Sita.,5 stars
And Angad shall live,5 stars
to reclaim his birth right.,5 stars
"Yes, little monkey, but know this.",5 stars
"If you fail to bring me Ram,",3 stars
I will devour a small piece of you,5 stars
each day as you feel agony for years.,5 stars
"I... I shall not fail you, great one.",5 stars
"I never knew you had it in you,",5 stars
old bear.,5 stars
I am getting too old for this.,2 stars
"You saved many lives today,",5 stars
but they're gone now.,3 stars
It's not them I'm worried about.,2 stars
Those creatures couldn't have taken down,5 stars
the dead beast in the forest.,5 stars
"If not them, then who?",3 stars
I think we're about to find out.,3 stars
Run!,1 star
Arm yourselves! Quickly!,5 stars
"Hey, you! Yes, you!",5 stars
The big one-eyed ugly!,1 star
Get lost! You'd better run,1 star
before I have to hurt you!,5 stars
Nal! Nil! Move!,1 star
You're no match for him.,5 stars
Get away quickly!,1 star
"You're braver than I thought,",5 stars
little ones.,4 stars
I almost had him.,2 stars
Or dumber. I haven't decided yet.,2 stars
"Now, get back.",1 star
Let me have a go at this demon.,5 stars
"No, Angad. Our attacks have no effect.",1 star
We need to save the wounded.,5 stars
What about you?,1 star
I'll keep him distracted.,3 stars
"Fall, you beast!",1 star
"I hit him with everything I had,",5 stars
and he barely felt it. How can that be?,1 star
He is protected by dark powers,4 stars
it seems.,3 stars
The giant is invulnerable,1 star
"to your blows,",5 stars
and yet all darkness fears the light.,5 stars
There.,5 stars
"Yes, old bear. I see it.",5 stars
He can't handle the light.,2 stars
His big eye. That's his weak spot!,3 stars
Nal! Nil!,1 star
We need rope. Lots of it!,5 stars
"Follow me, and do as I do.",5 stars
"What's the plan, Hanuman?",3 stars
Bring the demon down to size.,5 stars
Come on!,5 stars
"Now, Hanuman! Now!",5 stars
Now!,5 stars
"You did it, Hanuman.",5 stars
We all did it. Together.,5 stars
Even these fools helped.,5 stars
"You're true heroes now, little ones.",5 stars
I really almost had him,2 stars
the first time.,5 stars
What is it?,1 star
I've never seen you laugh before.,5 stars
It's scaring me.,5 stars
The vandevtas have returned,1 star
to this part of the forest.,5 stars
They no longer have to fear,5 stars
this creature.,5 stars
You've given them hope.,5 stars
"No, old bear, you have it wrong.",1 star
They've given hope to us.,5 stars
"Maybe you were right, Hanuman.",3 stars
That no matter how dark the night...,3 stars
the sun will always rise.,5 stars
"Why, Ram, why?",1 star
"Why, my sweet prince?",5 stars
Don't you know how much I love you?,5 stars
Even now?,2 stars
Who dares?,5 stars
Great one! Please forgive me.,5 stars
What did you hear?,5 stars
Tell me the truth!,5 stars
You... mentioned Prince Ram.,1 star
I thought you hated him?,1 star
I don't understand.,2 stars
Of course you don't. Look at you.,1 star
"You have never known true, deep love.",5 stars
But I have felt it once...,3 stars
when I first saw Prince Ram.,5 stars
Are you a god?,1 star
"No, dear lady.",1 star
I am simply Ram.,1 star
How may I help you?,5 stars
I have never seen a man,5 stars
so handsome and full of life.,5 stars
I ask of you only one thing,1 star
and my happiness will rival that,5 stars
of all the devs.,5 stars
"Ask, and I will do what I can",5 stars
to make you happy.,5 stars
"Then be my husband,",5 stars
noble and beautiful Ram.,5 stars
"Dear lady, ask of me anything else,",5 stars
but that I cannot be.,3 stars
"I have a wife, who is everything to me",5 stars
and wish for no other.,5 stars
Princess Sita.,5 stars
"That pasty, feeble thing?",1 star
"She is unworthy of you, sweet Ram.",1 star
"Let me devour her,",5 stars
then we can be happy.,5 stars
Stand away from her! Now!,1 star
"You think you can stop me, human?",1 star
I will feast on her bones!,5 stars
"Not while I live, demon.",1 star
No!,1 star
What have you done to me?,5 stars
What have you done to me!,5 stars
I was mutilated,1 star
despite my love for Ram.,4 stars
With a horribly injured face,1 star
"and a broken heart,",1 star
I fled.,1 star
Fled all the way to the nearby kingdom,1 star
"of my rakshas kin, Janasthan.",5 stars
"Yet, even 14,000 rakshasas",1 star
could not prevail against the mighty Ram.,2 stars
Ram was as skilled as he was handsome.,5 stars
There was then just one,1 star
who could give me justice for my injuries.,5 stars
"My brother, Ravan.",5 stars
He flew on his great Pushpak Viman,5 stars
and abducted that pitiful Sita.,1 star
"I had asked him to devour her,",2 stars
but he grew enamoured with this woman.,3 stars
"However, he will tire of her soon enough,",3 stars
and then her life will end,5 stars
and Ram will love only me.,5 stars
You... you believe Ram will love you,5 stars
after Si... his wife is dead?,2 stars
Of course.,3 stars
Do you think otherwise?,3 stars
No... no. Not at all.,1 star
You will be a most worthy wife.,5 stars
"Less flattery, more work!",3 stars
My rakshas could not defeat Hanuman.,5 stars
He is the most exceptional vaanar.,5 stars
"So, we must be more cunning.",3 stars
Take this.,5 stars
Poison?,1 star
Darkness in a bottle.,5 stars
"It will not kill,",1 star
but it will corrupt.,3 stars
"It will twist the victim's nature,",4 stars
"bringing their darkest desires,",5 stars
their darkest appetites to the surface.,5 stars
This may not work on Hanuman.,1 star
"It's not for him, for there is another",2 stars
that will respond well to it.,4 stars
Angad. His strength matches Hanuman's.,4 stars
And this darkness,5 stars
will make him even stronger.,5 stars
There is a king nearby,3 stars
"who has no love for Ram,",5 stars
for Ram is responsible,4 stars
for killing,4 stars
someone important to him.,5 stars
Use whatever guile you have,5 stars
to ensure this is the path Hanuman takes.,5 stars
"He must be guided to King Suketu,",5 stars
who will surely destroy him,1 star
in case Angad fails.,3 stars
How can I do this?,5 stars
Hanuman does not consider me,2 stars
one of his advisors.,4 stars
He has that troublesome Jambhvan,2 stars
at his side.,3 stars
Wait for the right moment.,1 star
I will lay a bait,5 stars
that a hero like Hanuman,5 stars
will be unable to resist.,2 stars
"Prince Angad, you look thirsty.",2 stars
"Here, share my water.",5 stars
Thank you.,5 stars
"Hariya, isn't it?",1 star
You were a councillor to my father.,5 stars
I was. How kind of you to remember.,5 stars
I mourn the loss of your great father,5 stars
every day.,5 stars
We will not see his kind again.,2 stars
"Now, our leaders",5 stars
are made of lesser material.,3 stars
Hanuman is a noble vaanar.,5 stars
"I've had my differences with him,",4 stars
but that's the past now.,3 stars
You are gracious.,5 stars
But I would expect no less,3 stars
from the son of Vaali.,5 stars
"Yes, Hanuman is strong,",5 stars
but he is not wise like you.,3 stars
"He was not raised to lead others,",2 stars
but to serve. He is not a prince.,3 stars
"Hanuman saved us, Hariya.",5 stars
"It was a feat I could never imagine,",5 stars
"or ever achieve, alone.",5 stars
"My Prince, you would never have",5 stars
brought us here to die.,5 stars
Hanuman is fool and a dangerous one.,1 star
He will kill us all,5 stars
unless you do something.,1 star
Hey! Be quiet!,5 stars
All you've done is complain,3 stars
and moan ever since we left Kishkindha!,5 stars
"Hanuman is our leader,",5 stars
and that's the end of it!,5 stars
Fools will always follow fools.,5 stars
Be gone with you.,5 stars
Don't call my brother a fool!,1 star
I called you both fools.,1 star
Then it's okay.,3 stars
"Wait, what? You...",1 star
Let Hariya go.,5 stars
I said let him go!,1 star
What happened?,1 star
Son?,1 star
- Prince Angad!,5 stars
#NAME?,2 stars
"Stop mothering me, you old bear!",1 star
Get off me!,1 star
"Are you all right, Prince Angad?",5 stars
"Never better, Hariya.",5 stars
Never better.,2 stars
I thought we were making progress with him,3 stars
these last few days.,5 stars
We did. Something doesn't feel right.,3 stars
"For a second, I thought his eyes...",2 stars
Help me!,5 stars
Please!,1 star
Help me!,5 stars
You need to get me out!,5 stars
You have to hurry.,5 stars
Please! Before he comes back.,1 star
#NAME?,1 star
#NAME?,5 stars
"Ruma's husband, Sugreev,",4 stars
"made a grave oath to Ram,",1 star
that his men would find Princess Sita,4 stars
within 30 days,1 star
or they would pay for their failure,1 star
with their lives,5 stars
And now that time has run out,2 stars
Out of the four generals,4 stars
"who searched for her,",5 stars
only three returned,1 star
"The first was General Shatabali,",3 stars
who searched the north,5 stars
He journeyed to the top of Mount Kaal,4 stars
But Princess Sita was nowhere,3 stars
to be found in the north,3 stars
Mighty General Vinata went east,5 stars
and faced the gargantuan serpent Ananta,5 stars
and a sea of fire,5 stars
But Princess Sita was nowhere,3 stars
to be found in the east,3 stars
Clever General Sushena went west,4 stars
and told Sugreev of how he battled,5 stars
winged lions at the peak of Mount Somagiri,4 stars
"And yet, Princess Sita was nowhere",2 stars
to be found in the west,4 stars
Sugreev was furious at their failure,1 star
"It was the duty of Ruma, as wife and Queen",5 stars
"of Kishkindha, to calm her husband's rage",5 stars
She reminded him,5 stars
that one general still remained,5 stars
That in Hanuman lay all their hope,5 stars
Where are we?,1 star
This doesn't look right,1 star
What do you mean?,1 star
The stars,4 stars
They're not in the right place,2 stars
"Oh, no!",1 star
"It's not the stars, Jambhvan",2 stars
It's us,5 stars
Time passed while we were in the cave,3 stars
How much time?,2 stars
"Based on the location of the stars,",4 stars
I fear weeks have passed,1 star
Weeks? How is that possible?,2 stars
We must have been in the cave,5 stars
for that entire time,5 stars
It must have been the illusions of the cave,5 stars
when we first encountered Shurpanakha,3 stars
"So, the demoness had the last laugh",3 stars
after all,3 stars
What... What does that mean?,1 star
It means it's all over,3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
"If we go back to Kishkindha, it's...",3 stars
"What do we do, Hanuman?",5 stars
"Welcome, King Sugreev",5 stars
Would you like to share our meal?,4 stars
"No, Lord Ram... I...",1 star
I am afraid I come bearing bad news,1 star
Once again?,1 star
"Patience, brother",5 stars
King Sugreev is our guest,5 stars
"Please sit, my friend",5 stars
"As you know, the time",5 stars
that we were supposed to find Princess Sita,4 stars
has expired,1 star
And what have your men found?,5 stars
What are you so afraid to tell us?,1 star
Three of my generals have returned...,1 star
empty-handed,1 star
They found no trace of Princess Sita,2 stars
"in the east, west or north",3 stars
And now? Do you remember your oath?,5 stars
How you would slay your vaanars?,5 stars
My actions weigh heavily on my soul,5 stars
Will they now pay the ultimate price,5 stars
for your failure?,1 star
"So, once again you break your word",3 stars
You put your soldiers' lives on the line!,5 stars
And now what? You wish mercy from us?,1 star
I don't ask for mercy,1 star
What I did to you was wrong,1 star
I lost myself in celebration,5 stars
I forgot the debt I owed you,1 star
"In my hubris and arrogance,",5 stars
I put my men's lives on the line,5 stars
They are not at fault. I am,2 stars
I failed at being a good king,1 star
"So please, Lord Ram,",5 stars
punish me instead,1 star
"As one king to another,",5 stars
spare my men and let me die,1 star
in their place,5 stars
Has Hanuman returned?,1 star
What?,1 star
Has Hanuman returned from the south?,3 stars
No. We haven't received word,1 star
from him or Prince Angad since they left,1 star
Then you have not broken any oath,1 star
You promised us,5 stars
that only when all your men returned,1 star
would their lives be forfeit,2 stars
We shall wait,1 star
Go back to your kingdom,5 stars
No one needs to die today,5 stars
What if Hanuman returns,1 star
empty-handed as well?,1 star
"Have faith, Lakshman",5 stars
There is more to Hanuman,3 stars
than any of us can imagine,5 stars
And he will never give up,5 stars
until he finds Sita,3 stars
"You seem lost, my friend",5 stars
Jambhvan... I need to speak with you,5 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
But not here,2 stars
Where do you suppose they're off to?,1 star
Probably to discuss,3 stars
how we're going to return to Kishkindha,5 stars
We're not really going to return,1 star
"to Kishkindha, are we?",1 star
Only if we're eager to die,3 stars
at King Sugreev's hands,5 stars
"What is it, Hanuman?",5 stars
Hanuman?,1 star
Hanuman!,5 stars
Son...,5 stars
Hanuman? Are you all right?,1 star
I'm not,1 star
"Something's wrong with me, Jambhvan",2 stars
Tell me,5 stars
Let me show you instead,1 star
"How am I doing this, Jambhvan?",5 stars
When did this start?,1 star
Last night,5 stars
I crushed a stone to dust in my hands,1 star
Did Shurpanakha do something to me?,2 stars
Did the demon curse me?,1 star
What is it?,1 star
Can't you hear it? These sounds,5 stars
in the air... The humming noises,2 stars
"Hanuman, listen to me",5 stars
You must...,5 stars
Enough!,3 stars
That was Angad!,2 stars
"Hanuman, wait! We must talk",5 stars
You are all vaanars of Kishkindha!,1 star
Born and bred to be our strongest warriors!,5 stars
"And yet you sit here like cowards,",5 stars
questioning your leaders!,5 stars
"What else can be done, Prince Angad?",1 star
We've failed to find Princess Sita,1 star
Only death awaits us in Kishkindha,5 stars
Hanuman has led us to our doom!,5 stars
Watch what you say about Hanuman!,5 stars
"He could have left me to die,",2 stars
and yet he saved my life,5 stars
"If you want to be angry at anyone,",1 star
be angry at me,1 star
"If it weren't for me,",3 stars
we would never have entered Rikshabila,1 star
Maybe we would have found Princess Sita,3 stars
"in time, too",5 stars
I owe you all my life,5 stars
You stood by me and now it has cost you,5 stars
Which is why I shall not stand by,1 star
and allow any of you to die!,5 stars
Angad?,3 stars
"No, Hanuman. You fought for me,",1 star
so now let me fight for you,5 stars
What's going on?,1 star
Our quest has failed,1 star
We do not know where Princess Sita is,3 stars
or how to find her,4 stars
Returning home,1 star
would mean death for everyone,1 star
"And so, we should not return",1 star
We must make a new home!,5 stars
Start over! What say you?,1 star
Praise Angad! Hail Angad!,5 stars
We won't return! We won't go back!,1 star
"And you, Hanuman?",1 star
"What say you, my brother?",5 stars
I say this is madness,1 star
You are too tied,1 star
by your loyalty to Ram,5 stars
You have lost sight,5 stars
that this quest is lost,1 star
We can't just abandon our mission,1 star
There is more at stake here,4 stars
"than just our lives, Angad",3 stars
Look at the evils we have seen,5 stars
since we left home,5 stars
The evil Ravan has unleashed!,5 stars
Finding Princess Sita,5 stars
may be the only chance we have,3 stars
to help Ram,5 stars
destroy this darkness forever!,5 stars
"If we stray from our path, our dharm,",5 stars
then we are allowing the world,5 stars
to be consumed by the rakshasas!,5 stars
We will be worse than cowards!,1 star
At least cowards live to see another day,1 star
We'd live to be with our families,5 stars
And could you live without honour?,5 stars
Could you stomach that shame,1 star
every time you meet your family's eyes?,5 stars
"Even if we were to continue, we don't",1 star
know how to even find Princess Sita,5 stars
Why allow so many vaanars to die,1 star
for the cause of one human?,1 star
Prince Ram would not give up,1 star
"on a life. Any life, so neither shall I",1 star
We are vaanars of Kishkindha!,1 star
Kishkindha is our home and nowhere else!,5 stars
It is up to you to decide,3 stars
I shall not force you,1 star
But if you choose to lay down,3 stars
"and give up,",1 star
"then you may escape from Lakshman's arrows,",3 stars
but can you run away from yourself?,3 stars
"You did the right thing, my friend",5 stars
"Why must Angad always oppose me,",1 star
Jambhvan?,2 stars
"His heart is in the right place,",5 stars
even though his mind is not,2 stars
Do you... do you hear that?,2 stars
That... I do hear,3 stars
What is this?,5 stars
It cannot be,1 star
I thought they were merely legends,2 stars
A legend that can smell you,5 stars
"from a mile away, you stinky old bear!",5 stars
What are you creatures?,1 star
They are the Vila...,5 stars
"Quiet, you walking rug!",5 stars
We can tell our own story,4 stars
You are looking at the Vaalakhilya,3 stars
Powerful and venerable sages,5 stars
and esteemed devotees of the gods!,5 stars
"Now, who are you, monkey?",5 stars
I am Hanuman of the vaanars,5 stars
This is Jambhvan,1 star
"My brothers,",5 stars
perhaps we have been stuck here so long,3 stars
that this era has been taken over,5 stars
by monkeys,4 stars
"No, our home is in Kishkindha",1 star
We've journeyed far on a mission,4 stars
"You, however, seem trapped here...",3 stars
How did this happen?,1 star
The tale of how we ended up here,5 stars
must surely be told,5 stars
across this world in song!,5 stars
It isn't. No one else has heard of you,1 star
An injustice! Wrinkled old bear!,5 stars
Sit then and hear the song of legend!,5 stars
"Make yourselves comfortable,",5 stars
it will take a few days to hear the telling,3 stars
We don't have that kind of time,2 stars
"Let's go, Hanuman",5 stars
Okay! I can shorten our story,3 stars
It'll only take a few minutes,3 stars
Wait! Hold on!,1 star
Don't go! Come back!,1 star
"Please, it has been",1 star
so long since we saw anybody else,5 stars
Very well,5 stars
"But please, we don't have much time",3 stars
Hanuman? Jambhvan?,2 stars
"I'm sorry, Hanuman, but I've made up my mind",3 stars
I cannot let you just throw away your life...,1 star
What in the world?,5 stars
Another listener! Good!,5 stars
The more the merrier,3 stars
What's going on?,1 star
Just sit down and listen,1 star
Maybe you'll learn something,3 stars
"Ages ago, Saptarishi Kashyap,",5 stars
one of the most powerful sages,5 stars
"in the universe, performed a great ritual",5 stars
All creatures on Earth,5 stars
were asked to bring something,2 stars
to contribute to the great ritual,5 stars
"Even we, the mighty Vaalakhilya,",5 stars
protectors of all life on Earth,5 stars
"from the burning sun,",5 stars
brought what we could carry,5 stars
on our backs to gift the great sage,5 stars
But the great God Indra,5 stars
found the sight of us amusing,3 stars
He laughed at us!,5 stars
"We Vaalakhilya might be small,",3 stars
but our pride is as vast as the ocean,4 stars
"And so, with our collective might,",5 stars
"we cursed Indra,",1 star
but then he too cursed us,2 stars
to return the favour,1 star
"We were trapped within this tree,",1 star
cursed to be scorched,1 star
by the heat of the sun,5 stars
"day after day,",4 stars
until a great being came to shade us,5 stars
"from the blistering noon-day sun,",5 stars
which scorches us for our hubris,5 stars
in cursing a god,5 stars
It has done so for endless years,5 stars
"We prayed, and the great vulture Jatayu",5 stars
would come to shield us with his mighty wings,4 stars
"Oh, no",1 star
What does the young monkey mean by that?,3 stars
"He... Jatayu is dead, great sage",5 stars
I bet there are juicy berries,3 stars
"at the top, Nil",1 star
"Don't remind me, Nal",1 star
Remember the berry tree,5 stars
Mother planted in our yard?,1 star
What was that?,1 star
"If Jatayu is no more,",3 stars
then there is no hope,1 star
"And now, once again, the sun",5 stars
will shine its curse upon us,5 stars
You best leave. The heat will,5 stars
be unbearable. We're stuck here anyway,1 star
"Come, Hanuman. It is their destiny",5 stars
to face this curse. We should go,5 stars
I will protect you from the sun,5 stars
What? Why do you keep trying,1 star
to throw your life away?,1 star
Spending your life protecting and saving,5 stars
"others is not throwing it away, Angad",2 stars
That is the lesson Prince Ram taught me,5 stars
"I will find Princess Sita,",5 stars
and I will save these sages,5 stars
I will save everyone I can,5 stars
Why won't he listen to reason?,1 star
Because he tends to listen,4 stars
to his heart,5 stars
Who knew monkeys could be this brave?,1 star
"Jambhvan, am I seeing things or is he...",2 stars
growing?,2 stars
A trick of the light perhaps?,3 stars
"Yes, it has to be, but...",3 stars
"Monkey, you are no ordinary monkey,",5 stars
are you?,1 star
"Hanuman, are you all right?",5 stars
"I'll be fine, Angad",3 stars
"Great sages, how do you fare?",5 stars
The curse is finally broken!,1 star
"Jambhvan, look!",5 stars
"You have helped free us, monkey...",5 stars
Hanuman. We can never truly repay you,1 star
"I simply performed my duty, great sage",5 stars
"You better listen, or I'll curse you!",1 star
Rarely does the Earth see a creature,2 stars
so devoted to their principles as you,5 stars
We Vaalakhilya will not forget you,5 stars
We will sing songs of your praise,5 stars
"That is not necessary, great sage",5 stars
"Instead, sing songs in memory",2 stars
of the great vulture Jatayu,5 stars
If he had not been mercilessly killed,1 star
"by the demon Ravan,",4 stars
"he surely would have been your saviour,",1 star
instead of me,1 star
Praise be to Hanuman!,5 stars
"And praise forever be to Jatayu,",5 stars
whose death will be remembered,5 stars
by the Vaalakhilya for all eternity!,5 stars
Hanuman... I think we should talk,4 stars
"Hey, wait up! Don't leave me behind!",1 star
What kind of birds are those?,3 stars
Praise be to Indra! Praise be to Hanuman!,5 stars
"And praise forever be to Jatayu,",5 stars
whose death will be remembered,5 stars
by the Vaalakhilya for all eternity!,5 stars
"Well, those were some weird talking birds",3 stars
Must be parrots,5 stars
Something is weird about this,2 stars
This is strange!,1 star
Jatayu!,1 star
"Grab my hand, Nal!",1 star
Mother will be furious if you die!,5 stars
This is so not good,1 star
"It's over, Sugreev.",2 stars
I've taken back Kishkindha from you.,1 star
I've taken your wife from you.,5 stars
"And now finally,",5 stars
I will take your life from you!,5 stars
What is Hanuman doing?,5 stars
Giving me a target.,5 stars
Vaali?,1 star
Please stop.,1 star
Get away from him!,1 star
Father! Are you... are you...,5 stars
"I'm sorry, Angad.",2 stars
This is the only way it could end.,1 star
Traitor! I'll kill you for this!,1 star
"The challenge is finished, Angad.",3 stars
I don't want to fight you.,1 star
I don't care!,1 star
Why did you even return?,1 star
You should have stayed in hiding,1 star
like the coward you are!,5 stars
My brother had lost his way.,2 stars
The kingdom needed to be saved.,4 stars
My father was right.,5 stars
All you want is his throne.,5 stars
It's all you've ever wanted!,5 stars
Do you really believe that?,1 star
"If you truly believe that,",1 star
then strike me down.,1 star
#NAME?,1 star
- Release me!,1 star
Who... who are these humans?,1 star
"I know how you feel, Angad,",3 stars
but you must calm yourself.,4 stars
How would you know,5 stars
"how I feel, Hanuman?",5 stars
Sugreev must pay for what he's done!,5 stars
It wasn't Sugreev,3 stars
who killed your father. It was me.,5 stars
What? But you challenged Vaali,3 stars
to a duel. And this...,5 stars
Oh!,5 stars
You cheated? You have no honour!,1 star
Did Vaali have honour?,1 star
Honour? You speak of honour?,1 star
He killed his brother. His own brother!,5 stars
He took his brother's wife.,4 stars
He made his people prisoners,5 stars
in their own kingdom.,5 stars
He broke the code of kings.,1 star
None of that was an act of honour.,1 star
No.,1 star
I will have my revenge.,5 stars
"Save your rage, Angad.",1 star
"We will settle that later,",3 stars
if we must.,3 stars
"For now, it's time to say goodbye",5 stars
to your father.,5 stars
"Go, son.",5 stars
"Who are you, human?",1 star
"I am Ram, son of Dashrath.",5 stars
King Dashrath of Ayodhya?,1 star
I have heard stories of your father.,5 stars
"An honourable man,",5 stars
if there ever was one.,1 star
Why did you choose,1 star
to stand by Sugreev?,2 stars
Ravan has taken my wife.,5 stars
"Sugreev offered to help, but for that",3 stars
he needed his kingdom back.,3 stars
Foolish human.,1 star
"If you had come to me,",2 stars
I would have returned your wife,1 star
with a snap of my fingers.,4 stars
"It is not just for that reason, Vaali.",2 stars
You dishonoured yourself.,1 star
You exiled your brother,1 star
and took his wife from him.,5 stars
You became no different from Ravan.,2 stars
Sugreev stole my kingdom.,5 stars
He thought you were dead.,1 star
"By law, the kingdom was his.",5 stars
"When you returned,",1 star
"he was willing to give it back to you,",5 stars
but your pride and anger blinded you,5 stars
to your brother's devotion.,5 stars
You broke the code of kings,1 star
"and committed an act of adharm,",5 stars
when you took your brother's wife.,5 stars
"By doing that, Vaali,",5 stars
your life was forfeit.,1 star
"Remember your honour, Vaali.",5 stars
Remember your true self.,5 stars
"So that, in death, you may find peace.",3 stars
Brother.,5 stars
Forgive me.,1 star
Angad.,3 stars
My son.,5 stars
"Sugreev is your king, now.",5 stars
Do as he says and...,4 stars
do not hate this human.,1 star
He only did what was necessary.,3 stars
He...,3 stars
He fulfilled his duty.,4 stars
He has redeemed me.,3 stars
"Rest now, Mahabali Vaali.",5 stars
"In death, the world will remember",5 stars
your nobility and virtue.,5 stars
Let him go.,1 star
"In time, Angad will understand.",4 stars
What is this?,5 stars
This is Ram.,5 stars
Sugreev was crowned King of Kishkindha,5 stars
with Angad declared,1 star
as the heir to the throne.,5 stars
The joyous coronation,5 stars
was celebrated greatly in Kishkindha.,5 stars
King Sugreev promised to uphold his oath,1 star
made to Lord Ram,5 stars
to scour the realms,5 stars
and find Princess Sita.,5 stars
"However, the arrival of the monsoon",3 stars
delayed the start of the search.,2 stars
Prince Ram granted Sugreev,1 star
a three-month delay,1 star
in the search because of the rains.,4 stars
"Meanwhile, the celebrations continued",3 stars
in Kishkindha...,3 stars
and continued...,5 stars
and continued.,5 stars
"Until Sugreev, to the shame of all vaanars",1 star
forgot his promise to Lord Ram...,2 stars
long beyond the passing,5 stars
of the monsoon.,5 stars
Your Majesty!,5 stars
You have a visitor. It is most urgent,4 stars
that you meet with him.,5 stars
Tell him to come later.,4 stars
"My King, you must awaken.",5 stars
"I've tried talking to him,",2 stars
but he says promises have been broken.,3 stars
Promises you made.,5 stars
What happened to the king,5 stars
that was destined to lead our people,3 stars
to greatness?,5 stars
"That king seems to be gone,",3 stars
drowning himself in drink,1 star
and blind to oaths once made.,1 star
"Leave me be, Hanuman.",1 star
Let me get some sleep.,3 stars
Whoever it is can wait.,3 stars
What was that?,1 star
What's going on?,1 star
"It's your visitor, my King.",5 stars
"Prince Lakshman, and he is angry.",1 star
Where is Sugreev?,1 star
Put... put your weapon down.,1 star
Bring me Sugreev!,5 stars
"You have broken your oath, Sugreev!",1 star
And now you must pay!,5 stars
"What have I done, Hanuman?",5 stars
Do the humans mean to kill me?,1 star
"You broke your oath, my King.",5 stars
You have brought this on yourself.,5 stars
How did it come to this?,5 stars
No matter. Do not worry.,1 star
I will fix this.,5 stars
"This is your last chance, Sugreev!",5 stars
Answer me or I will shatter,1 star
your kingdom to pieces!,1 star
Lakshman!,5 stars
"Hold it, my friend Lakshman.",5 stars
"You call me friend, oath breaker?",1 star
"You are right to be angry,",5 stars
Prince Lakshman.,5 stars
I have been a disloyal friend,1 star
to you and your brother.,5 stars
I lost myself in my own pride,5 stars
and excesses. I betrayed my word.,1 star
I have no excuse,1 star
but to place myself at your mercy.,3 stars
"If you spare my people,",5 stars
"I promise you now,",5 stars
"on my life, that I will send",5 stars
my forces around the world,5 stars
and find Princess Sita,5 stars
within 30 days for Lord Ram.,5 stars
If we fail to find Princess Sita,3 stars
"within 30 days,",1 star
the lives of my soldiers and mine,5 stars
will be forfeit.,2 stars
"What say you, Hanuman?",1 star
Is your king finally one,5 stars
who will keep his oath?,1 star
Or does my bow need to sing,3 stars
even louder?,1 star
"Mistakes have been made, Lakshman,",1 star
but I have faith my king,5 stars
will not let you down again.,2 stars
How can you be so sure?,5 stars
Because I will also sacrifice my life,5 stars
if Princess Sita cannot be found.,3 stars
I will be one of the soldiers,5 stars
trying to find her.,4 stars
"But, Hanuman...",3 stars
"Very well, Sugreev.",5 stars
"Because of Hanuman, I will give you",5 stars
this last chance to make things right.,5 stars
"Thank you for your mercy,",5 stars
Prince Lakshman.,5 stars
I will summon our army at once.,5 stars
What have you done?,5 stars
Why did you say that?,1 star
I never intended for you to be one,1 star
of the soldiers.,5 stars
You're too valuable to me.,2 stars
You should have thought of that before,3 stars
you put the lives of our soldiers at risk?,1 star
How could I stand by helplessly?,1 star
What choice did I have?,5 stars
I broke my word. This was the only way,1 star
to show them my seriousness.,5 stars
The soldiers won't like it.,2 stars
"I know, but it's time we prepare.",3 stars
Summon all the tribes,5 stars
"and my generals, Hanuman.",5 stars
Let Kishkindha know,5 stars
their king is back.,5 stars
"What is it that troubles you,",1 star
husband?,1 star
Something...,2 stars
An emptiness which gnaws endlessly,5 stars
at me from within.,5 stars
Not emptiness. Guilt.,1 star
I... I don't understand.,2 stars
Guilt because you think,1 star
you should have killed Vaali yourself.,1 star
Guilt because you feel you failed.,1 star
But you are wrong.,3 stars
Come with me.,5 stars
Where?,1 star
Look at this glorious kingdom.,5 stars
You brought this glory to it.,5 stars
You are the leader,5 stars
who freed his people from tyranny.,5 stars
The brother who made an impossible choice,5 stars
of killing his own kin.,1 star
That burden you will always carry,5 stars
in your soul.,5 stars
"However, your story is not one of failure.",3 stars
It is one of triumph.,5 stars
A triumph that has brought us,5 stars
together again.,5 stars
"Thank you, Ruma.",5 stars
"As always, you are right.",5 stars
I know what I must do.,5 stars
"Lord Ram, I have come to ask",5 stars
your forgiveness and to fulfil my oath.,5 stars
You are an honourable king,5 stars
and a true friend.,5 stars
And friends don't need to ask,5 stars
for forgiveness.,5 stars
"This is Lord Ram,",5 stars
son of King Dashrath of Ayodhya.,5 stars
I have summoned you here to send you,5 stars
on a most dangerous mission.,1 star
Are you brave enough to accept it?,5 stars
Vinata fears nothing. Command me!,5 stars
That is why,3 stars
"you shouldn't rely on weapons, Vinata.",5 stars
"Release me on your enemies,",5 stars
"King Sugreev,",3 stars
and I shall rip and tear my way,1 star
through them with my own fangs!,5 stars
"Ah, the brashness of youth.",1 star
Victory is rarely won,1 star
"through brute force, Sushena,",5 stars
but through cunning and wisdom.,4 stars
"Let me lead this mission,",5 stars
King Sugreev.,3 stars
"I expected nothing less,",3 stars
wise Shatabali.,5 stars
You are hereby ordered,5 stars
to scour this realm,1 star
"to find Princess Sita of Mithila,",4 stars
wife to Lord Ram.,5 stars
She has been taken,4 stars
by the rakshas king Ravan.,5 stars
You must complete this task,5 stars
"in 30 days,",5 stars
or the lives of you,5 stars
and your vaanars will be forfeit.,1 star
Do you accept this mission?,1 star
"My King, we will follow you",5 stars
"to the ends of the Earth,",5 stars
"but to condemn your own soldiers,",3 stars
"likely to death, for a human.",2 stars
This defies reason.,1 star
Enough! This human is the reason,5 stars
we are alive today,5 stars
and not dead at Vaali's feet.,5 stars
"Shatabali, I dishonoured our people",1 star
by ignoring my promise to the Prince.,5 stars
He must know the seriousness,4 stars
by which I will make this right.,4 stars
This is no longer the reign of Vaali,1 star
but a new time for our people.,4 stars
A time of honour,5 stars
but no lives will be forfeit.,2 stars
You will succeed,5 stars
because our cause is true and just.,5 stars
And that gives me faith.,5 stars
Faith in you.,5 stars
"And in you, Sushena, and you, Vinata.",5 stars
Faith that you will find the Princess,5 stars
and bring honour to our people.,5 stars
- For Kishkindha!,5 stars
- For the vaanars!,5 stars
For our King Sugreev!,5 stars
As I expected. You will be sent,5 stars
in four different directions.,4 stars
Vinata shall lead his tribe,5 stars
eastwards and search there.,5 stars
Sushena shall go west.,1 star
Wise Shatabali shall search north.,5 stars
And the party heading towards the south,4 stars
shall be led by you...,5 stars
Hanuman.,5 stars
"I cannot refuse your command,",1 star
my King.,5 stars
"But perhaps I would be better as a soldier,",3 stars
not to lead a party.,1 star
"No, my friend.",1 star
"You are meant for more, Hanuman.",5 stars
"Are you sure about this, King Sugreev?",5 stars
He is young and inexperienced.,3 stars
He has fought beside me in battle,5 stars
with pride and honour.,5 stars
But will his followers respect him?,3 stars
Will he be able to lead them?,3 stars
I believe in him.,5 stars
Perhaps someone else can go,3 stars
with Hanuman?,2 stars
It would have to be one,3 stars
of our most powerful warriors.,5 stars
"Not a warrior, but a leader.",3 stars
Someone unshakeable.,1 star
Angad.,3 stars
I want to welcome Prince Angad's leadership,5 stars
"on this mission, my King.",5 stars
What?,1 star
Angad?,3 stars
Me?,2 stars
No soldier would disobey,1 star
"the Crown Prince himself, yes.",5 stars
"Yes, this is a good plan.",4 stars
"This was your plan all along,",5 stars
wasn't it?,1 star
What?,1 star
You are sending these poor fools,1 star
to their deaths.,5 stars
And you want to get rid of me,5 stars
along with them.,5 stars
"Angad, please...",3 stars
You want me gone to make sure Vaali's,3 stars
legacy never has a claim to Kishkindha!,5 stars
"Angad, I would never!",2 stars
You want me dead?,1 star
Just like you wanted my father dead?,1 star
Enough!,3 stars
I haven't summoned all of you,1 star
for a debate.,4 stars
I've called you all here,5 stars
because it's our responsibility.,5 stars
"The invitation was mine,",5 stars
but the decision is yours alone.,3 stars
I shall go.,5 stars
"Perhaps I should go with them,",3 stars
my King.,5 stars
Someone will need to keep these young pups,3 stars
on the right path.,5 stars
"As you wish, Jambhvan.",5 stars
"So, it is decided!",3 stars
Go forth and find Princess Sita.,5 stars
The honour of Kishkindha depends on it.,3 stars
You have only 30 days.,1 star
"A word, my Lord?",5 stars
"Tell me, my friend.",5 stars
I do not know why Lord Sugreev,3 stars
chose me to lead.,5 stars
I do not believe I am the best one,5 stars
for this mission.,4 stars
"However, I wanted you both to know",3 stars
that your burden is now mine.,5 stars
I shall not rest,1 star
until I find Princess Sita.,4 stars
"I shall not fail you, Lord Ram.",5 stars
"On this, I swear.",1 star
And I shall never lose,5 stars
"my faith in you, Hanuman.",5 stars
"On this, I swear.",1 star
"Thank you, Lord Ram.",5 stars
"Look at him, Jambhvan.",5 stars
How can he be so calm,5 stars
after all that has happened?,3 stars
"The battle with Vaali,",4 stars
his wife's abduction.,4 stars
How can a warrior like him,5 stars
"be so peaceful, so humble?",2 stars
Perhaps he is wise enough,3 stars
to know restraint.,4 stars
Power without restraint,5 stars
leads only to destruction.,3 stars
Everything has changed,5 stars
since he arrived.,5 stars
"Everything I thought I knew,",5 stars
thought I was seem insignificant now.,2 stars
I have much to learn from this man.,5 stars
Ready?,3 stars
"Are you sure you're up for this, Jambhvan?",3 stars
It will be a difficult journey and well...,4 stars
Forgive me... you are quite old.,2 stars
"I am not bedridden yet, my boy.",5 stars
Perhaps I just need a bit of a walk.,3 stars
Who knows? You may just need me.,5 stars
"I used to be quite the fighter, you know.",3 stars
"Old friend, I fear if it comes down",3 stars
"to that, we may all be in trouble.",3 stars
"Don't worry, and I may know a secret",5 stars
"or two to share, as well.",4 stars
Like what?,3 stars
"Like the sun, look there.",5 stars
Did you know some say,3 stars
the sun tastes a bit like a mango?,3 stars
The sun tastes like mango?,2 stars
I think too much sun is affecting,2 stars
"your brain, wise bear.",5 stars
I can see this is going to be,5 stars
a long journey.,5 stars
"Of that, my friend,",5 stars
you have no idea.,5 stars
I fear for her,1 star
"She is all alone,",5 stars
held by the demon king,5 stars
She is too gentle a soul,2 stars
for such torment,5 stars
"Sita will not falter, dear brother",5 stars
"She, like all women,",5 stars
possesses the divine feminine force,5 stars
"Ask any child the name of the goddess,",1 star
and you will hear one word,1 star
Mother,5 stars
"Nothing could exist without her,",1 star
"without the divine feminine force,",1 star
the prime energy of the universe,5 stars
"She is all-loving, all-nurturing",5 stars
The mother of us all,5 stars
And fiercely protective,5 stars
of those she loves,5 stars
"And when enraged,",5 stars
she becomes fury itself,5 stars
An unstoppable force,1 star
The power of,5 stars
the divine feminine force,5 stars
is capable of,5 stars
destroying the universe entirely,1 star
"So, it is the demon king",3 stars
who should worry,1 star
"For all his powers, Ravan has awoken",5 stars
divine forces that will destroy him,5 stars
What you say is true,5 stars
"Her faith, her spirit, is unshakable",1 star
If only we had other divine forces,3 stars
aiding us,5 stars
We have Hanuman,5 stars
"I love Hanuman as my brother, but...",3 stars
"The other generals have all returned, Ram",1 star
Where is he?,1 star
The long silence makes my hope fade,3 stars
The faith that I have in Sita,5 stars
"and in you, Lakshman, I have in Hanuman",5 stars
There are forces within him,3 stars
that will transform the world,5 stars
In Hanuman?,1 star
Though he doesn't yet realize it,3 stars
I just hope he discovers it in time,3 stars
For there is much work to do,4 stars
"This, brother,",5 stars
is the best idea we've ever had,5 stars
"The best idea I've had,",5 stars
for I'm older and wiser,3 stars
"And with this,",5 stars
we'll save Princess Sita for sure,5 stars
We'll be heroes,5 stars
The toast of Kishkindha,5 stars
Mother will be so proud...,5 stars
of me,5 stars
"Magnificent, isn't it?",5 stars
Of course!,4 stars
You're incredibly brave,5 stars
Really?,1 star
Because there is no way,1 star
I'd ever sail in that,5 stars
"You just wait, Hanuman",1 star
You don't see the potential in it,3 stars
I think I've seen enough for now,4 stars
Princess Sita is on the far side of this,3 stars
"sea, and there's no other way across it",2 stars
"If we're to save her,",1 star
then we'll need boats,3 stars
We'll have the Princess back,3 stars
by tomorrow!,5 stars
Or... the day after?,2 stars
Maybe we need to find,3 stars
another way across,5 stars
You and your stupid ideas,1 star
My ideas?,2 stars
"Whatever it is, we must do something",5 stars
"What do you think, Hanuman?",5 stars
Hanuman?,1 star
Who's there?,1 star
Hanuman? Who is where?,1 star
"Jambhvan, didn't you hear it?",2 stars
Hear what?,1 star
There are voices in the wind,2 stars
They are telling me something,3 stars
You must have heard them,5 stars
I did not. But perhaps their message,2 stars
is just for you,5 stars
Message?,1 star
But what...,3 stars
We have a problem,3 stars
What problem?,1 star
"We have plenty of wood,",4 stars
but no skill in boat-making,2 stars
"I, too, can't do any better",2 stars
What other choice do we have?,5 stars
"If we start with something simple,",3 stars
we might be able to sail across,3 stars
to Lanka and rescue the Princess,5 stars
There are other ways,3 stars
to cross the sea,5 stars
You mean swim?,1 star
If there's anything we do worse,1 star
"than boat-building, it's swimming",3 stars
"Water is not our element, old bear",2 stars
"I was not talking of swimming,",1 star
but jumping,3 stars
"From tree to tree,",5 stars
not across an entire ocean,2 stars
That's impossible,1 star
"You could do it, Hanuman!",5 stars
The leap is nothing to you,1 star
A hundred miles,5 stars
would hardly stretch your muscles,2 stars
You've leapt so much further,2 stars
So much further,2 stars
Don't you remember?,5 stars
Remember what?,1 star
What you truly are,5 stars
"Jambhvan, you know I trust you,",5 stars
but you're starting to sound a bit cra...,3 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
That voice again,5 stars
You must remember,5 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
Who's there?,1 star
Why do you call me?,1 star
Hanuman,4 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
Who are you?,5 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
What do you want of me?,5 stars
Tell me!,5 stars
"What, Angad? What?",2 stars
I can't hear you!,5 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
It's drowning you out!,5 stars
"What wind, Hanuman? There is no wind",1 star
"Calm yourself, brother",5 stars
What do you want of me?,5 stars
I don't understand. He screams at nothing,1 star
What's wrong with him?,1 star
"Nothing is wrong, and his words are",5 stars
directed at something beyond our world,5 stars
Beyond our understanding,5 stars
"Help him, Jambhvan",5 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
What's happening?,1 star
There are voices all crying out!,1 star
I don't understand!,1 star
Steady yourself. This tempest has not come,1 star
to strike you down,5 stars
but to raise you up,3 stars
Things have been hidden from you,1 star
"for too long, Hanuman",2 stars
Things? What things?,3 stars
Your true nature,5 stars
It is time you know the truth,5 stars
What truth?,1 star
I'm just an ordinary vaanar,1 star
"No, Hanuman",1 star
You know there is more,3 stars
You must admit it to yourself,5 stars
"The foes you have conquered,",5 stars
the terrible creatures that not even,1 star
the mighty Vaali could have defeated...,3 stars
the treachery you uncovered,5 stars
from within your own people...,5 stars
and saved us from more subtle traps,5 stars
that almost robbed us of our will,5 stars
These are not actions,1 star
of an ordinary vaanar,1 star
I did what I had to do,4 stars
That is all,1 star
You did...,3 stars
what no one else could accomplish,5 stars
You led us here...,5 stars
to where we will find Princess Sita,5 stars
Do not fear,5 stars
"what is happening to you, Hanuman",5 stars
Your entire life has led up,5 stars
to this very moment,5 stars
"Awake, Hanuman",5 stars
Open your inner eye,5 stars
See the world as it truly is,5 stars
See who you truly are,5 stars
He is ready. Ready to know,5 stars
Ready to remember,5 stars
That's a mango,1 star
"There is a mango, Mother",1 star
I want it!,5 stars
It is too high for you and me,2 stars
I'll get you another...,1 star
But I want that one!,4 stars
I will have that mango,5 stars
"I'm coming to get you, juicy mango",5 stars
I thought it was a dream,3 stars
No. Not a dream. A memory,1 star
One taken from you,1 star
to protect you and us all,5 stars
I... I remember this,5 stars
And why do you believe,5 stars
you are an ordinary vaanar?,1 star
When you are so much more,2 stars
"But, as a child, you did not understand",3 stars
how to limit your powers,5 stars
You had to be stopped,1 star
in case you accidentally destroyed,5 stars
the three realms,4 stars
The gods had a duty to all existence,5 stars
"Though you have no malice in you,",3 stars
your limitless potential,1 star
had to be contained,1 star
"So, they stole my powers?",2 stars
No. They knew that one day,1 star
the world would need you,5 stars
"So, they came to your home",3 stars
soon after,2 stars
The gods themselves decided...,4 stars
that there was only one way,1 star
to protect the universe...,5 stars
and that was to make you forget,5 stars
"There are too many memories stirring,",2 stars
Jambhvan,3 stars
I don't know which to believe,3 stars
Who am I?,5 stars
Tell me,5 stars
That is not for me to tell,2 stars
Then who will tell me?,3 stars
You must hear this from your father,5 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
Who... who's there?,1 star
Hanuman,4 stars
Please show yourself,5 stars
Who are you?,5 stars
"I am your father, Hanuman",5 stars
Vayu,1 star
"Hanuman learned that Swayamprabha,",4 stars
"the powerful yogini of the forest,",5 stars
had been captured,1 star
"Ravan's sister, the fearsome demon",4 stars
"Shurpanakha, had tricked the yogini,",1 star
preying upon her kindness,4 stars
to strike when her guard was down,1 star
Shurpanakha imprisoned the yogini,1 star
in a binding spell,5 stars
and stole her immense power,5 stars
"for her own,",4 stars
corrupting what was pure,1 star
and threatening all of nature's creatures,5 stars
in the forest,5 stars
Finally! There it is,5 stars
Rikshabila,5 stars
"We must hurry, Jambhvan",5 stars
Rescuing Swayamprabha is the only chance,4 stars
we have to save Angad,3 stars
"We're not going in there, are we?",1 star
"Please just leave me to die,",1 star
Hanuman,4 stars
You still have time to find Princess Sita,4 stars
and save yourselves,1 star
Nothing can save me now,5 stars
I can't fight this for much longer,2 stars
The evil is retaking him,1 star
"What will we find inside that cave,",5 stars
traitor?,1 star
I don't know. I don't know!,1 star
She didn't tell me anything!,1 star
I told you I had no choice,1 star
Shurpanakha would have killed me,2 stars
She may yet still. I plan on reuniting you,4 stars
with your mistress,5 stars
"So, why don't you do us the honour",3 stars
of taking the first step,4 stars
"inside Rikshabila, Hariya?",1 star
This place is beautiful,5 stars
Don't be fooled by its beauty,5 stars
That which is beautiful,5 stars
can also be deadly,2 stars
This cave was created,5 stars
"by Vishwakarma,",4 stars
"also known as rakshas Maya,",3 stars
the master of illusion,5 stars
"A place of illusions,",5 stars
where men and gods forgot,5 stars
who they were,5 stars
and became trapped,1 star
in their desires forever,5 stars
Angered by,1 star
"the cave's dangerous illusions,",5 stars
Indra struck down Maya,1 star
and drove him away from the cave,1 star
and entrusted the cave to be guarded,5 stars
by the powerful yogini Swayamprabha,5 stars
"From that day forth,",5 stars
Swayamprabha never left this place,5 stars
The power of the cave,5 stars
"was hers to control,",4 stars
and she swore,1 star
to protect mankind with it...,5 stars
until Shurpanakha stole the cave's power,4 stars
in her mad quest to take revenge,5 stars
against Ram and Lakshman,1 star
#NAME?,1 star
#NAME?,1 star
Look. This is the third time we've,5 stars
walked past these same flowers,1 star
The illusions of the cave,5 stars
are making us walk in circles,5 stars
There's no way to escape,1 star
The cave's magic won't let us leave,1 star
We're trapped here,1 star
It's Shurpanakha! She's found us!,5 stars
"Hanuman, you must lead us out",5 stars
of this and destroy their fears,5 stars
Look deep within yourself,5 stars
and find the truth. Find the way,5 stars
"In the darkest day, in the blackest night,",5 stars
let hope guide you with its eternal light,5 stars
Ram,1 star
Ram,1 star
Ram,1 star
Follow me,5 stars
Lady Swayamprabha?,1 star
"Good, you heard my singing",4 stars
"Welcome, Hanuman",5 stars
I have been waiting for you,5 stars
"You're safe? But Shurpanakha, how?",3 stars
It was not easy,2 stars
The demon tricked me,1 star
"She imprisoned me and stole my power,",5 stars
but she underestimated me,3 stars
Thank the gods,5 stars
"We feared the worst, my lady",1 star
"You must be the wise, Jambhvan",5 stars
The forest is filled with stories,4 stars
of your heroism,5 stars
"I had a vision that you were coming,",2 stars
that you needed my help,5 stars
Did Shurpanakha escape?,1 star
"No, I destroyed that vile creature",1 star
Her terror over this forest,5 stars
is gone forever,5 stars
Praise the gods!,5 stars
I couldn't bear to look,2 stars
at that hideous face again!,5 stars
You must be hungry,5 stars
Please enjoy this food and drink,5 stars
Regain your strength,5 stars
We must first help Angad,5 stars
Your friend's life hangs by a thread,5 stars
The poison that infected him,1 star
is burning him from the inside,1 star
Let me try some healing spells,3 stars
"Look, brother, all the food's gone",1 star
"Not all, brother",1 star
"But not enough for two, I'm afraid",3 stars
My mango!,5 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
My mango!,5 stars
All right! Challenge accepted!,5 stars
"Jambhvan, keep an eye on those two",2 stars
They'll get lost in the caves,3 stars
I'll be back quickly,3 stars
"Don't worry, brother",5 stars
"We will cure you, Angad",5 stars
"Hanuman, please...",1 star
this place,5 stars
"Sleep, brave one",5 stars
The pain is too great for him,2 stars
A sleeping spell will allow him to rest,3 stars
Can he be saved?,1 star
"There may be a way,",3 stars
but it would have a high cost,3 stars
Are you prepared to pay it?,1 star
"For Angad, anything",3 stars
Good. I promise,4 stars
we will save your friend,5 stars
Let me gather some supplies,3 stars
You. Come with me,5 stars
#NAME?,5 stars
#NAME?,1 star
He needs you,3 stars
I did this to Prince Angad,5 stars
Let me at least try to help fix it,3 stars
"No sign of that bird anywhere,",1 star
and no sign of my mango!,1 star
Mango!,5 stars
"You mean, my mango",5 stars
Meant only for yours truly,2 stars
Mango!,5 stars
I hear it. Over there,3 stars
"Give me that, you thief!",5 stars
"Wait, Nal. What's that?",1 star
That's Swayamprabha,3 stars
Why does she have a statue of herself?,1 star
Will you look at that?,3 stars
Even I don't think so highly of myself,2 stars
That's not a statue,1 star
Tell me what to do,5 stars
"Quickly,",5 stars
just up ahead down this path,5 stars
Do not fear,5 stars
The evil that tormented you is gone now,5 stars
I owe you my life,5 stars
for destroying that horrid demon,5 stars
"Despite her flaws,",3 stars
Shurpanakha seemed to love Ram very much,4 stars
Love?,1 star
Shurpanakha could know nothing of love,1 star
Her face will give me nightmares,5 stars
"Her nose was missing, sliced off!",1 star
I've never seen Princess Sita,1 star
"but, without a doubt,",3 stars
she must be far more beautiful,5 stars
than that hideous rakshasi,1 star
Stop! Stop saying her name!,1 star
Whose name?,1 star
Princess Sita's? But why?,3 stars
"Yes, I understand. But how?",3 stars
Fill us in?,1 star
"What's that bird telling you, old bear?",1 star
"Yes, and why did it steal my mango?",1 star
This is the real Swayamprabha,5 stars
The woman we met before is really,5 stars
the rakshasi Shurpanakha in disguise,5 stars
"Then, Hanuman and Angad...",1 star
We have to get back!,5 stars
Wait! Shurpanakha is still stealing,1 star
Swayamprabha's immense power,5 stars
Unless we free her and cut off,1 star
"the demon's power, we are all dead",5 stars
"That bird, it brought us here, didn't it?",1 star
Does it know how to help her?,3 stars
"This bird is a part of Swayamprabha,",5 stars
a part of her very soul,5 stars
Shurpanakha made the mistake of ignoring it,1 star
when she trapped the yogini's body,1 star
"What can we do, Jambhvan?",5 stars
It's telling me of a mantra,3 stars
that may break the spell,3 stars
"Quickly, together, we must try",5 stars
Come on,5 stars
"I hurried back,",1 star
for I sensed Angad's pain,3 stars
- We don't have much time,2 stars
#NAME?,1 star
"He's gathering more herbs,",4 stars
but that won't be enough,3 stars
There is only one way,1 star
Tell me how to save him,5 stars
"I will need to take some of your strength,",3 stars
"your power,",5 stars
your very life energy,5 stars
and transfer it to him,1 star
Then hurry. We must save Angad,1 star
"This will weaken you, Hanuman",5 stars
But do not fear;,3 stars
it will only take a minute,2 stars
This strength,5 stars
Just a bit more,3 stars
I have never known such power,1 star
Just a bit more,3 stars
What are you?,5 stars
No!,1 star
You... No...,1 star
I have never tasted this much power,1 star
I need more!,5 stars
Impossible!,1 star
You have access to limitless power,1 star
"And you don't even know the truth,",5 stars
do you?,1 star
You waste such power,1 star
"I will take all your strength, all of it",5 stars
"No, get off of me",1 star
Then I will feast on Sita's bones,5 stars
"And when I see Ram again,",5 stars
I will be his equal,5 stars
"No, more powerful than him",2 stars
I will be his master!,5 stars
"You want my strength, demon?",1 star
"Yes, yes. More, I need more",5 stars
What's slowing you down?,1 star
"Here, take it! Take it all!",5 stars
"No, wait. It's too much",1 star
Your strength is too much. I can't!,1 star
"Take enough to burst on it, monster",1 star
I have plenty of strength to give,5 stars
Let go! I beg you! Let go!,1 star
"I can't absorb this much, please!",1 star
The pain! Stop!,1 star
Not until you free Angad,1 star
Release him from the curse,1 star
I can't! There is no cure,1 star
Nothing can save him now,5 stars
The darkness has taken over his soul,5 stars
"Your strength, your power,",5 stars
it burns like the sun,2 stars
I can't contain it,2 stars
Take it back! Take it all back!,1 star
"Hanuman, thank the gods",5 stars
you're all right,5 stars
Hanuman! Look out!,5 stars
I'll tear you apart!,5 stars
No. That's what I'll be doing to you,1 star
You! How did you get free?,1 star
You dare trap me like this,5 stars
"Jambhvan, you freed her?",1 star
"You think you've won,",1 star
foolish vaanar?,1 star
You have no idea,5 stars
what my brother will do to you,5 stars
Ravan will pick his teeth,4 stars
"with your bones,",5 stars
while he crushes Ram's head,2 stars
under his foot,2 stars
Ravan will kill you...,5 stars
Silence!,1 star
Your hideous voice,1 star
shall never be heard again,1 star
The power of this cave,5 stars
is mine to wield again,5 stars
Now I will make you suffer,5 stars
for what you have done to me,5 stars
"You will die in terror, monster",5 stars
You dare!,5 stars
Sometimes we have no choice,3 stars
"but to take a life,",3 stars
but to show mercy,3 stars
takes even greater strength,5 stars
"Wise words, young vaanar",5 stars
Thank you,5 stars
I learned them from a friend,4 stars
Anger is an emotion I have not felt,1 star
in many lifetimes,5 stars
Today you stopped me,1 star
from succumbing to it,1 star
Can you help him?,5 stars
The demon's poison,5 stars
has corrupted him too much,2 stars
I don't know if I can help now,3 stars
Please. Please try,1 star
It's not working,1 star
We have to keep trying!,5 stars
Angad,3 stars
"Angad! Arise, my brother, arise!",1 star
Hanuman?,1 star
"It is good to have you back,",4 stars
my friend!,5 stars
"We are ready, Lady Swayamprabha",5 stars
"As I said, while I do not know",4 stars
"where Princess Sita is being held,",4 stars
this portal will save you weeks of travel,5 stars
and take you to the coast,5 stars
She was heading there,3 stars
when Ravan took her,1 star
"Thank you, Lady Swayamprabha",5 stars
I only wish I could do more,3 stars
"If I may ask,",3 stars
what will happen to Shurpanakha?,1 star
"She will remain here,",5 stars
away from harming the world,5 stars
I will make sure she sees justice,4 stars
for what she did to your friend Hariya,4 stars
"Well, ""friend"" is a bit much",3 stars
Traitor!,1 star
"Yes, but he has been punished",3 stars
for his part in this,4 stars
"Let's go, you two",1 star
"Old bear, a word",5 stars
"Old bear, really?",2 stars
You're probably at least five times my age,3 stars
"Yes, but I don't look it",3 stars
"Women don't age, kind sir",3 stars
You saved Angad,1 star
"For that, I will always be in your debt",3 stars
"You're wrong, Jambhvan",1 star
I didn't save Angad; Hanuman did,3 stars
Hanuman's power has been reawakened,4 stars
It's time he learns the truth,5 stars
To know the truth of such power,5 stars
comes with a heavy weight,3 stars
Yes. Power without compassion,5 stars
means nothing. He reminded me of that,1 star
Yes. He has changed,3 stars
since we left Kishkindha,5 stars
Perhaps it is finally time,3 stars
"Safe journey, old bear",5 stars
"As for you, demon",5 stars
Your punishment will be to watch,5 stars
Hanuman bring,5 stars
your brother's empire down,1 star
and to see Ram reunite,5 stars
"with his one true love, Princess Sita",5 stars
"Where are you, Princess Sita?",1 star
O Princess Sita,5 stars
Sita... Sita...,2 stars
do you?,1 star
Just sit down and listen,1 star
What's slowing you down?,1 star
and no sign of my mango!,1 star
you are an ordinary vaanar?,1 star
"Nirvani, where are you going?",1 star
"Nal, what happened?",1 star
just before we left.,1 star
There are dangerous people about.,1 star
I have never tasted this much power,1 star
be unbearable. We're stuck here anyway,1 star
Stop him! Hariya is behind this,1 star
Please! Before he comes back.,1 star
"No, my Lord. I swear it.",1 star
empty-handed as well?,1 star
and steal from everyone,1 star
you put the lives of our soldiers at risk?,1 star
Do you have anything else left,1 star
A rakshas like this rarely enters,1 star
No! There's a strength,1 star
No kingdom will prosper under a king,1 star
Fled all the way to the nearby kingdom,1 star
Don't go! Come back!,1 star
"Nirvani, where were you?",1 star
The demon tricked me,1 star
and fouling their yagnas,1 star
This is a creature unfamiliar to us,1 star
This is no longer the reign of Vaali,1 star
Nirvani! Nirvani!,1 star
I broke my word. This was the only way,1 star
What? Impossible,1 star
I broke my word. This was the only way,1 star
Jatayu!,1 star
We won't return! We won't go back!,1 star
"Angad! Arise, my brother, arise!",1 star
Then why didn't you tell him?,1 star
he'll be nothing.,1 star
"Even if we were to continue, we don't",1 star
He's been infected by Patal magic,1 star
They were banished,1 star
How can I make Ravan feel my pain?,1 star
my friend?,1 star
"Please, he is only a child.",1 star
Not something solved,1 star
Where are we?,1 star
Jatayu! Jatayu!,1 star
You should have stayed in hiding,1 star
We apologise if we have disturbed,1 star
you put the lives of our soldiers at risk?,1 star
They terrorized the holy men,1 star
Sugreev was furious at their failure,1 star
of thousands should be a burden.,1 star
I learned that she trapped,1 star
Stop! Stop saying her name!,1 star
I don't understand. He screams at nothing,1 star
Remember what?,1 star
Jatayu!,1 star
"You want my strength, demon?",1 star
Hanuman?,1 star
"No, brother.",1 star
"Why, Ram, why?",1 star
Speak before I rip your tongue off,1 star
What's happened to him?,1 star
and you will hear one word,1 star
"Father, you already exiled him.",1 star
Did the demon curse me?,1 star
Stolen from my home last night,1 star
You mean swim?,1 star
doomed to fail.,1 star
"Now, get back.",1 star
- Leave it!,1 star
Hanuman. We can never truly repay you,1 star
The cave's magic won't let us leave,1 star
I don't ask for mercy,1 star
and no creature from Swarg,1 star
I said let him go!,1 star
I won't release them,1 star
in Kishkindha anymore.,1 star
What? This worked earlier!,1 star
I told you I had no choice,1 star
Please forgive him.,1 star
Maybe they have nothing to do,1 star
of hollow existence,1 star
Please. Please try,1 star
It's all so unbelievable,1 star
The poison that infected him,1 star
means nothing. He reminded me of that,1 star
"Ravan slew your brother,",1 star
Enough! We are not here,1 star
He would never return.,1 star
Please shoot the arrow.,1 star
We are not welcome,1 star
What?,1 star
If there's anything we do worse,1 star
I never touched your stinking...,1 star
Vayu,1 star
even if you tried,1 star
There must be something,1 star
"Oh, no!",1 star
a three-month delay,1 star
corrupting what was pure,1 star
against Ram and Lakshman,1 star
and was killed for his mistake,1 star
He could not let Mayavi destroy,1 star
What if Hanuman returns,1 star
"When we returned, Sita was gone.",1 star
Apart from the hair!,1 star
Nal! Nil!,1 star
Not emptiness. Guilt.,1 star
I see terror,1 star
"Brother, where are you? Nal!",1 star
There are voices all crying out!,1 star
and was killed for his mistake,1 star
"Stop mothering me, you old bear!",1 star
"I see no gold, or treasures, or gifts.",1 star
then there is no hope,1 star
I failed at being a good king,1 star
What happened in the forest?,1 star
And we may never be able to find,1 star
That is all,1 star
Get away from him!,1 star
"We were trapped within this tree,",1 star
No!,1 star
No!,1 star
The leap is nothing to you,1 star
"One day, Sita spotted",1 star
"even using magic, but nothing works",1 star
What?,1 star
"Yet, even 14,000 rakshasas",1 star
You are an insolent one,1 star
and save yourselves,1 star
Release me!,1 star
"Then, Hanuman and Angad...",1 star
Help him?,1 star
from the kingdom of Ravan?,1 star
and his wrath was terrible to behold,1 star
Hanuman? Who is where?,1 star
the truth about Hanuman?,1 star
punish me instead,1 star
Vayu,1 star
Nirvani! Nirvani!,1 star
Jatayu?,1 star
Get away!,1 star
Do you accept this mission?,1 star
Or you?,1 star
Hanuman would never have believed me,1 star
No. Of course not.,1 star
Apart from the hair!,1 star
then all hope is lost,1 star
The pain! Stop!,1 star
Whose name is the very scream,1 star
No!,1 star
The pain! Stop!,1 star
even louder?,1 star
Stop! Stop saying her name!,1 star
"No, not a god, my Lord",1 star
Forgive my deception.,1 star
Where are you?,1 star
Then who am I? What am I?,1 star
"On hearing this boon, Lord Brahma,",1 star
It isn't. No one else has heard of you,1 star
changed anything if I did.,1 star
It's not working,1 star
The cave's magic won't let us leave,1 star
"Why, Ram, why?",1 star
Then why haven't you?,1 star
that this quest is lost,1 star
He's been cursed,1 star
Something is wrong with you,1 star
turned their backs on you?,1 star
"Stop mothering me, you old bear!",1 star
Who brought outsiders into our home?,1 star
Why hasn't Prince Ram released his arrow?,1 star
"Hey, wait up! Don't leave me behind!",1 star
He totally crushed you,1 star
What?,1 star
No... no. Not at all.,1 star
It can't be over. No...,1 star
has been sorely misplaced,1 star
Your hideous voice,1 star
What? How can this be happening?,1 star
I nearly passed out!,1 star
"I show you nothing, my son, except",1 star
I said let him go!,1 star
I never intended for you to be one,1 star
"were also so loyal, so inseparable.",1 star
No... no,1 star
"We were trapped within this tree,",1 star
I was sorry to hear,1 star
Prince Ram granted Sugreev,1 star
Do you want me to give you my word?,1 star
- Leave it!,1 star
be unbearable. We're stuck here anyway,1 star
"the wind god, Vayu, carried them away",1 star
easily pushed aside,1 star
Then you're a fool,1 star
You have been banished.,1 star
It can't be over. No...,1 star
Who's there?,1 star
We need to turn back and throw ourselves,1 star
You mean swim?,1 star
If he had not been mercilessly killed,1 star
Where are you?,1 star
Why did you even return?,1 star
whose heart is corrupt.,1 star
How could I do any less?,1 star
The evil is retaking him,1 star
Message?,1 star
How can you say that? Isn't mother,1 star
You... No...,1 star
Did the demon curse me?,1 star
"he stood unmoving,",1 star
"Angad! Arise, my brother, arise!",1 star
So came the terrible Mayavi,1 star
The evil is too strong. You'll die,1 star
"I am a vaanar, but my name is...",1 star
"Jambhvan, you freed her?",1 star
Get away!,1 star
This is Jatayu's brother?,1 star
named Kabandha,1 star
whose heart is corrupt.,1 star
"I can't absorb this much, please!",1 star
destroying their homes,1 star
"When we returned, Sita was gone.",1 star
than to live trapped,1 star
if there ever was one.,1 star
The curse is finally broken!,1 star
- Leave it!,1 star
be angry at me,1 star
How could I stand by helplessly?,1 star
This was my only chance. Please help me!,1 star
from him or Prince Angad since they left,1 star
"I see no gold, or treasures, or gifts.",1 star
Did the demon curse me?,1 star
Traitor!,1 star
turned their backs on you?,1 star
it flew away,1 star
corrupting what was pure,1 star
What's happening?,1 star
A rakshas like this rarely enters,1 star
I never intended for you to be one,1 star
My King?,1 star
You had to be stopped,1 star
There was then just one,1 star
What? A guava?,1 star
One creature he overlooked,1 star
Jatayu!,1 star
A cry?,1 star
Where is he?,1 star
yet who can stop him?,1 star
Has Hanuman returned?,1 star
lying in the dirt?,1 star
Hanuman. We can never truly repay you,1 star
husband?,1 star
How could I do any less?,1 star
That's impossible,1 star
Did the demon curse me?,1 star
Why do you show me such things?,1 star
didn't you?,1 star
#NAME?,1 star
"Except my revenge, everything!",1 star
I had no choice!,1 star
Who... who are these vaanars?,1 star
and drove him away from the cave,1 star
We will starve!,1 star
"When we returned, Sita was gone.",1 star
The evil is retaking him,1 star
Why hasn't Prince Ram released his arrow?,1 star
You come as envoys of Ram?,1 star
He chilled my blood.,1 star
Ram. Ram,1 star
"I have failed,",1 star
You... No...,1 star
This is a creature unfamiliar to us,1 star
"On this, I swear.",1 star
I can't! There is no cure,1 star
Let me go. Save yourselves,1 star
No kingdom will prosper under a king,1 star
Someone unshakeable.,1 star
King Sugreev promised to uphold his oath,1 star
Your fists won't help you here,1 star
he cannot do such harm.,1 star
Jatayu!,1 star
Stop him!,1 star
Won't you?,1 star
"Get away from me, you buffoon!",1 star
How did this happen?,1 star
Guilt because you think,1 star
"Uncle, that's where you're wrong",1 star
our lives are forfeit,1 star
Once again?,1 star
You waste such power,1 star
to strangle Vaali with my own bare hands,1 star
I don't know. I don't know!,1 star
Hanuman is fool and a dangerous one.,1 star
Why do you keep us here?,1 star
"When you returned,",1 star
"What happened next, Your Majesty?",1 star
Release me!,1 star
Returning home,1 star
- Release me!,1 star
"He cannot rule himself, so what hope",1 star
are going to stop Hanuman?,1 star
"Please, without his powers,",1 star
into pieces. Easy!,1 star
who sent two warriors,1 star
Vaali.,1 star
"If you too fell to evil,",1 star
and your vaanars will be forfeit.,1 star
Don't touch it,1 star
"I hurried back,",1 star
I say this is madness,1 star
What is it?,1 star
How did this happen?,1 star
"Don't be proud, boy. Let me help.",1 star
"Where are you, brother?",1 star
shall never be heard again,1 star
No. I forbid you from helping him,1 star
Look over there.,1 star
Stop him!,1 star
"Now they are few. Exiled, hunted.",1 star
from the kingdom of Ravan?,1 star
We will be worse than cowards!,1 star
We're trapped here,1 star
"The other generals have all returned, Ram",1 star
Ram's love for his wife was boundless,1 star
I see terror,1 star
"On this, I swear.",1 star
"You should go back into hiding, uncle.",1 star
The cave's magic won't let us leave,1 star
Where is he?,1 star
went to the fearsome asuras,1 star
do you?,1 star
or they would pay for their failure,1 star
are you?,1 star
"On this, I swear.",1 star
"Hey, wait up! Don't leave me behind!",1 star
How bad is it?,1 star
"at the top, Nil",1 star
we would never have entered Rikshabila,1 star
What's going on?,1 star
of terror,1 star
Vaali!,1 star
Fail me and your death,1 star
"I cannot reach you, Jatayu",1 star
"You want my strength, demon?",1 star
A tyrant to your own people,1 star
Did you know he could do that?,1 star
Start over! What say you?,1 star
Lady Swayamprabha?,1 star
"You think you can stop me, human?",1 star
You don't make requests of me,1 star
And now what? You wish mercy from us?,1 star
Today you stopped me,1 star
Hanuman? Who is where?,1 star
Lady Swayamprabha?,1 star
You have returned!,1 star
was tricked by Ravan,1 star
Then you have not broken any oath,1 star
Then hurry. We must save Angad,1 star
No. That's what I'll be doing to you,1 star
came to an end,1 star
"Isn't it, friend?",1 star
Why did you even return?,1 star
from turning into something...,1 star
Are you done?,1 star
for your failure?,1 star
Just sit down and listen,1 star
Then why haven't you?,1 star
Love?,1 star
"without my power, you have no hope",1 star
"Nothing could exist without her,",1 star
"Then, Hanuman and Angad...",1 star
No!,1 star
Are you prepared to pay it?,1 star
and she swore,1 star
"If we're to save her,",1 star
It's a painful story.,1 star
I broke my word. This was the only way,1 star
Who's there?,1 star
How could I do any less?,1 star
"Who are you, human?",1 star
or Patal could ever kill him,1 star
Where is everyone?,1 star
You are neither gods nor saviours.,1 star
We do not whip our own.,1 star
Do you want me to give you my word?,1 star
I never wanted to go on this quest.,1 star
"forget all his powers,",1 star
"I'm sorry, my friends",1 star
I have never tasted this much power,1 star
Then you have not broken any oath,1 star
I called you both fools.,1 star
Whose name is the very scream,1 star
Please!,1 star
What problem?,1 star
Those two warriors,1 star
That's a mango,1 star
I don't ask for mercy,1 star
Why?,1 star
Promise me you will not intervene,1 star
You come as envoys of Ram?,1 star
I don't care!,1 star
"Oh, no. She'll find me",1 star
This is Jambhvan,1 star
It's Hanuman?,1 star
in Kishkindha anymore.,1 star
How could I stand by helplessly?,1 star
What's happening to him?,1 star
and became trapped,1 star
I can't.,1 star
She was carried away,1 star
"Wait, son! Listen...",1 star
Do you represent Ram of Ayodhya?,1 star
"It will not kill,",1 star
of thousands should be a burden.,1 star
What is it?,1 star
"Why must Angad always oppose me,",1 star
walking through such a dangerous place.,1 star
Sugreev was furious at their failure,1 star
I fear we have failed,1 star
Victory is rarely won,1 star
Remember what?,1 star
We believed Vaali had perished,1 star
What is your name?,1 star
Sad eyes? Did you say sad?,1 star
What's going on?,1 star
That's not a statue,1 star
"Eventually, Mayavi escaped underground,",1 star
"No, old bear, you have it wrong.",1 star
The leap is nothing to you,1 star
Don't call my brother a fool!,1 star
Hanuman?,1 star
"The demon said nothing,",1 star
He thought you were dead.,1 star
tell him I'm sorry,1 star
"She is unworthy of you, sweet Ram.",1 star
You... No...,1 star
"I cannot refuse your command,",1 star
"If we're to save her,",1 star
"One day, Sita spotted",1 star
"Yet, without you, he is doomed to fail",1 star
Stop it or I'll give you one.,1 star
What's happening?,1 star
and no creature from Swarg,1 star
"at the top, Nil",1 star
What? Why do you keep trying,1 star
What could two humans want here?,1 star
And there is nothing,1 star
"No, old bear, you have it wrong.",1 star
She was carried away,1 star
"No, not a god, my Lord",1 star
No. Not a dream. A memory,1 star
What? A smile?,1 star
Your wife? By whom?,1 star
There was nothing,1 star
We're taking a big risk,1 star
your lord to die today? No?,1 star
I was kidnapped,1 star
Nal! Nil! Move!,1 star
"No, dear lady.",1 star
What are you creatures?,1 star
It can't be over. No...,1 star
This is strange!,1 star
Are you prepared to pay it?,1 star
You... No...,1 star
Your wife? By whom?,1 star
No. They knew that one day,1 star
I have no excuse,1 star
Please stop.,1 star
"Do something, Nal!",1 star
I don't know. I don't know!,1 star
Who? Who are you?,1 star
"inside Rikshabila, Hariya?",1 star
What was that?,1 star
"I see no gold, or treasures, or gifts.",1 star
You have returned!,1 star
when Ravan took her,1 star
Of course you don't. Look at you.,1 star
to stop thinking about it.,1 star
No. I would never become,1 star
and abducted that pitiful Sita.,1 star
"Please, please forgive me, Lord",1 star
What truth?,1 star
Why does she have a statue of herself?,1 star
Why did you say that?,1 star
that we do not,1 star
King Dashrath of Ayodhya?,1 star
Did I ever tell you that there's a fight,1 star
I have been a disloyal friend,1 star
I failed at being a good king,1 star
You have returned!,1 star
to be flapping your lips.,1 star
on my belongings?,1 star
Cursed be his name,1 star
and fouling their yagnas,1 star
and no creature from Swarg,1 star
Hanuman?,1 star
#NAME?,1 star
There was nothing,1 star
Who knew monkeys could be this brave?,1 star
He's been infected by Patal magic,1 star
No human has set foot,1 star
I want only Ram.,1 star
A slap! Stop pulling my tail.,1 star
Anger is an emotion I have not felt,1 star
There is a terrible fight happening,1 star
A pain you can no longer feel yourself,1 star
"It will not kill,",1 star
Lady Swayamprabha?,1 star
We were so worried!,1 star
Stolen from my home last night,1 star
would mean death for everyone,1 star
I don't want to fight you.,1 star
"What wind, Hanuman? There is no wind",1 star
"Exiles, you mean!",1 star
"If it's you, Nil, I'll skin your hide!",1 star
Nirvani! Nirvani!,1 star
But the sage spared no one,1 star
Which is why I shall not stand by,1 star
Prince Ram granted Sugreev,1 star
"Leave me be, Hanuman.",1 star
Take it back! Take it all back!,1 star
Stand down. I don't want to hurt you,1 star
to death.,1 star
are going to stop Hanuman?,1 star
Look out!,1 star
There is a terrible fight happening,1 star
I crushed a stone to dust in my hands,1 star
young man?,1 star
Jatayu!,1 star
He's been cursed,1 star
I said let him go!,1 star
How bad is it?,1 star
of terror,1 star
Don't touch it,1 star
to scour this realm,1 star
the terrible creatures that not even,1 star
I am simply Ram.,1 star
I am afraid I come bearing bad news,1 star
and I shall rip and tear my way,1 star
I hate Sita as much as you.,1 star
and your vaanars will be forfeit.,1 star
Why won't you... Your right hand,1 star
came forth to rampage,1 star
Things have been hidden from you,1 star
foolish vaanar?,1 star
Hanuman?,1 star
walking through such a dangerous place.,1 star
Who?,1 star
I am not afraid. Are you?,1 star
I thought you hated him?,1 star
Mother planted in our yard?,1 star
I never touched your stinking...,1 star
Stand away from her! Now!,1 star
Tataka's foolish husband,1 star
"What is it that troubles you,",1 star
Prince Ram granted Sugreev,1 star
Why not? You people saved my life,1 star
I thought you hated him?,1 star
No... no. Not at all.,1 star
do not hate this human.,1 star
None of that was an act of honour.,1 star
with no allegiance to any man or king.,1 star
instead of me,1 star
I have bled with you,1 star
Why should I spare him?,1 star
he was not the only one to suffer,1 star
Aren't I?,1 star
Which is why I shall not stand by,1 star
Has Hanuman returned?,1 star
are you?,1 star
There are voices all crying out!,1 star
You! How did you get free?,1 star
What problem?,1 star
Countless valiant kings fell,1 star
"Look, brother, all the food's gone",1 star
All because of you,1 star
than righting one wrong.,1 star
What? A smile?,1 star
"No, our home is in Kishkindha",1 star
"First Vaali sends a naag assassin,",1 star
Our quest has failed,1 star
I failed at being a good king,1 star
Someone is making mischief,1 star
to be squandered,1 star
You... No...,1 star
and fouling their yagnas,1 star
changed anything if I did.,1 star
remained undiminished.,1 star
we would never have entered Rikshabila,1 star
We will starve!,1 star
We were so worried!,1 star
Why should I spare him?,1 star
#NAME?,1 star
your limitless potential,1 star
"Nothing could exist without her,",1 star
Hanuman?,1 star
I want only Ram.,1 star
His name...,1 star
"Yes, and why did it steal my mango?",1 star
"Her nose was missing, sliced off!",1 star
"The demon said nothing,",1 star
Where are you?,1 star
"Don't be proud, boy. Let me help.",1 star
are going to stop Hanuman?,1 star
Get lost! You'd better run,1 star
Had Ram only listened,1 star
If he had not been mercilessly killed,1 star
"Isn't it, friend?",1 star
"I never wanted to be king, Jambhvan.",1 star
I've sipped misery from my bowl,1 star
and no sign of my mango!,1 star
"without my power, you have no hope",1 star
What? I could never...,1 star
"Who shook the tree, you?",1 star
A cry?,1 star
"You misunderstand me, child",1 star
#NAME?,1 star
I tried to warn you.,1 star
We're trapped here,1 star
Are you really that different?,1 star
"My Lord, they are vagabonds",1 star
You have only 30 days.,1 star
"Wait, what? You...",1 star
turned their backs on you?,1 star
We need to turn back and throw ourselves,1 star
"Stop mothering me, you old bear!",1 star
You exiled your brother,1 star
"No, our home is in Kishkindha",1 star
Help him?,1 star
a vaanar before.,1 star
"No, not destroyed.",1 star
His dying words told us,1 star
I said let him go!,1 star
"That pasty, feeble thing?",1 star
empty-handed as well?,1 star
Leaving her alone and unguarded.,1 star
Has Hanuman returned?,1 star
I cannot let you just throw away your life...,1 star
"No, not destroyed.",1 star
She had never seen anything,1 star
if you had to kill me.,1 star
What's happened to Angad?,1 star
wasn't it?,1 star
That's impossible,1 star
Mistress?,1 star
Hanuman is fool and a dangerous one.,1 star
"You want my strength, demon?",1 star
and this is no place to go wandering about.,1 star
"inside you, old bear?",1 star
spare my men and let me die,1 star
"If you truly believe that,",1 star
No. I won't let it happen,1 star
Ram,1 star
Once again?,1 star
wasn't it?,1 star
"You must not meet them, Lord Sugreev.",1 star
Leave him alone!,1 star
I would die of shame.,1 star
She couldn't have done all this,1 star
Why are you doing this?,1 star
Why fight from the shadows?,1 star
What is this creature?,1 star
Don't call my brother a fool!,1 star
"and give up,",1 star
I've sipped misery from my bowl,1 star
"If you truly believe that,",1 star
Your hate for her cannot compare to mine.,1 star
"If you truly believe that,",1 star
against Vaali!,1 star
"You fool, that's your left hand",1 star
Why do you want to see him?,1 star
Look out!,1 star
Humans? Here?,1 star
You have returned!,1 star
walked past these same flowers,1 star
There are voices all crying out!,1 star
They sent you here? Why?,1 star
from the kingdom of Ravan?,1 star
To forgive is to set a prisoner free,1 star
We will be worse than cowards!,1 star
Are you hurt?,1 star
my friend?,1 star
You will release me!,1 star
Who's there?,1 star
and drove him away from the cave,1 star
Leave him alone!,1 star
"Her nose was missing, sliced off!",1 star
"Wait, Nal. What's that?",1 star
I forgot the debt I owed you,1 star
if you had to kill me.,1 star
How bad is it?,1 star
"You think you've won,",1 star
"He demanded that no god, no deva,",1 star
"Believe it or not,",1 star
Ram,1 star
"Where are you, Hariya?",1 star
My life has no meaning without Sita.,1 star
Start over! What say you?,1 star
Would you deny this humble servant,1 star
Leave my things alone.,1 star
that there was only one way,1 star
We shall wait,1 star
Such evil cannot be given,1 star
"What sort of talk is this? What are you,",1 star
Get away quickly!,1 star
We dare not attack.,1 star
snatched a portion for itself,1 star
Let's return to Rishyamukh,1 star
Nal! Nil!,1 star
Don't touch me!,1 star
Where is everyone?,1 star
The borders of Kishkindha are no place,1 star
the fearless Lakshman?,1 star
Her loss would be the greatest suffering,1 star
"No, not my right, you fool",1 star
Don't touch me!,1 star
"No, not a god, my Lord",1 star
instead of me,1 star
Steady yourself. This tempest has not come,1 star
What's wrong with him?,1 star
You exiled your brother,1 star
There was then just one,1 star
Never speak that name in my presence,1 star
empty-handed as well?,1 star
"She is unworthy of you, sweet Ram.",1 star
That is all,1 star
"even using magic, but nothing works",1 star
The borders of Kishkindha are no place,1 star
I want only Ram.,1 star
I don't know. I don't know!,1 star
"In Ayodhya, there is neither Prince",1 star
Why are you doing this?,1 star
I'm not,1 star
Why me? You are the older one,1 star
No... no,1 star
"Forget, child... forget.",1 star
before they bring destruction upon us.,1 star
my friend?,1 star
Who? Who are you?,1 star
What is this creature?,1 star
gave him invulnerability against all?,1 star
What is this creature?,1 star
"I never wanted to be king, Jambhvan.",1 star
I tell you we are doomed!,1 star
Fled all the way to the nearby kingdom,1 star
#NAME?,1 star
"You are not such a man, are you?",1 star
I see terror,1 star
Seen what?,1 star
"Wait? Since when are you scared,",1 star
are you?,1 star
"to only serve others,",1 star
Do you have anything else left,1 star
We need to turn back and throw ourselves,1 star
Those two warriors,1 star
for the cause of one human?,1 star
"Where are you, Hariya?",1 star
we would never have entered Rikshabila,1 star
You saved Angad,1 star
Hanuman is fool and a dangerous one.,1 star
Do you really believe that?,1 star
"Disregarded, forgotten, broken.",1 star
It's unfair to play against one,1 star
She didn't tell me anything!,1 star
There is one thing,1 star
"Hanuman, wait!",1 star
He thought you were dead.,1 star
"You're wrong, Father.",1 star
Why did you scream?,1 star
a vaanar before.,1 star
Where are you?,1 star
the truth about Hanuman?,1 star
"Days turned to weeks,",2 stars
Perhaps it fell off in the forest?,2 stars
I used to be much worse.,2 stars
And then...,2 stars
I don't understand.,2 stars
Sugreev? Ruler of the vaanars?,2 stars
with sadness in her eyes,2 stars
"I had a vision that you were coming,",2 stars
"that may destroy us.""",2 stars
"Days turned to weeks,",2 stars
Or... the day after?,2 stars
We will not see his kind again.,2 stars
would their lives be forfeit,2 stars
"Better they be destroyed,",2 stars
If Vaali lost...,2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
I don't understand,2 stars
two different interpretations.,2 stars
"Nal, I'd stop that if I were you.",2 stars
We searched the city but feared the worst,2 stars
"I mean, Jambhvan",2 stars
soon after,2 stars
"See, they're just vines,",2 stars
You're too valuable to me.,2 stars
Hardly even worth it,2 stars
Then a quarter to Sumitra,2 stars
even my tail is limp.,2 stars
Something...,2 stars
It might be poisonous,2 stars
then our delay would be,2 stars
with a garland wrapped around my neck?,2 stars
"He was too stubborn and I couldn't say no,",2 stars
since Sita vanished.,2 stars
on the same side for once.,2 stars
Not while I am your leader.,2 stars
She is too gentle a soul,2 stars
with Hanuman?,2 stars
"I mean, Jambhvan",2 stars
Perhaps it fell off in the forest?,2 stars
The reign of Vaali is over.,2 stars
Meant only for yours truly,2 stars
until he is dead at my feet.,2 stars
I thought they were merely legends,2 stars
and your voice only makes it worse,2 stars
and may soon be extinguished forever.,2 stars
I'm getting too old for this,2 stars
two different interpretations.,2 stars
I can't fight this for much longer,2 stars
My mace would snap,2 stars
"Angad, I would never!",2 stars
Did Shurpanakha do something to me?,2 stars
Forgive me... you are quite old.,2 stars
Sita... Sita...,2 stars
So much further,2 stars
When you are so much more,2 stars
"He was not raised to lead others,",2 stars
"Unhand me, Angad! He's about to...",2 stars
part of asura and rakshas ancestry?,2 stars
"Something's disturbing you,",2 stars
I used to be much worse.,2 stars
For Ram lost much that day,2 stars
high? Just a moment. I would've just...,2 stars
We don't have that kind of time,2 stars
"It's almost over, now",2 stars
high? Just a moment. I would've just...,2 stars
I can't fight this for much longer,2 stars
That is not for me to tell,2 stars
He does not know the ways of the world,2 stars
He'd already tucked his tail,2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
"Seeing drops falling,",2 stars
"Your memory is short, Hanuman.",2 stars
I almost put an arrow through you.,2 stars
We are so similar.,2 stars
if it wasn't for these heroes,2 stars
I would rather die,2 stars
"Wait, if they surround your entire kingdom",2 stars
would their lives be forfeit,2 stars
"No, more powerful than him",2 stars
He does not know the ways of the world,2 stars
He does not know the ways of the world,2 stars
It's too late,2 stars
I almost had him.,2 stars
It's over,2 stars
Vaali has been corrupted.,2 stars
"Seeing drops falling,",2 stars
"It's almost over, now",2 stars
I do believe it would have laughed itself,2 stars
There are those that will defy,2 stars
But they were already dead and gone,2 stars
"for too long, Hanuman",2 stars
That was Angad!,2 stars
But they were already dead and gone,2 stars
"I mean, Jambhvan",2 stars
It would tear out his heart.,2 stars
"for too long, Hanuman",2 stars
delayed the start of the search.,2 stars
I am getting too old for this.,2 stars
There is nothing to worry about.,2 stars
even my tail is limp.,2 stars
part of asura and rakshas ancestry?,2 stars
I am not fit to face her any more.,2 stars
"Days turned to weeks,",2 stars
"There are too many memories stirring,",2 stars
she'll be really upset,2 stars
"Jambhvan, keep an eye on those two",2 stars
"Something's wrong with me, Jambhvan",2 stars
"For a second, I thought his eyes...",2 stars
"Ravan's gifts are countless,",2 stars
I do believe it would have laughed itself,2 stars
But they were already dead and gone,2 stars
Suketu?,2 stars
Something...,2 stars
But they were already dead and gone,2 stars
I don't understand,2 stars
with sadness in her eyes,2 stars
since Sita vanished.,2 stars
The reign of Vaali is over.,2 stars
But no.,2 stars
growing?,2 stars
"So, they stole my powers?",2 stars
"Water is not our element, old bear",2 stars
It was not easy,2 stars
not across an entire ocean,2 stars
until he is dead at my feet.,2 stars
"If we don't do his bidding,",2 stars
He should have returned by now.,2 stars
delayed the start of the search.,2 stars
"I mean, Jambhvan",2 stars
It's over,2 stars
He can't handle the light.,2 stars
I almost put an arrow through you.,2 stars
"Jambhvan, keep an eye on those two",2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
"And yet, Princess Sita was nowhere",2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
He does not know the ways of the world,2 stars
will be unable to resist.,2 stars
There are those that will defy,2 stars
He does not know the ways of the world,2 stars
Sita... Sita...,2 stars
Too much time has passed,2 stars
"that may destroy us.""",2 stars
soon after,2 stars
They are not great warriors.,2 stars
There is something...,2 stars
It's trying to eat me.,2 stars
"What, Angad? What?",2 stars
"Jambhvan, I don't feel so good...",2 stars
But his wings were ruthlessly ripped off,2 stars
I can't fight this for much longer,2 stars
Shurpanakha would have killed me,2 stars
#NAME?,2 stars
"Angad, I would never!",2 stars
will be forfeit.,2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
Not while I am your leader.,2 stars
"Others, unable to live under his tyranny,",2 stars
if I'd merely told him,2 stars
under his foot,2 stars
two different interpretations.,2 stars
She feeds off her power,2 stars
Perhaps you possess something,2 stars
"No, more powerful than him",2 stars
and your voice only makes it worse,2 stars
Even now?,2 stars
under his foot,2 stars
I should have followed him,2 stars
that hasn't already been done?,2 stars
When you are so much more,2 stars
We are so similar.,2 stars
Rarely does the Earth see a creature,2 stars
"Apart from you, you mean?",2 stars
"Nal, I'd stop that if I were you.",2 stars
"It's over, Sugreev.",2 stars
"There are too many memories stirring,",2 stars
will be unable to resist.,2 stars
They could be dangerous.,2 stars
No shiny shields or deadly swords.,2 stars
"If you had come to me,",2 stars
"Seeing drops falling,",2 stars
if I'd merely told him,2 stars
their minds became twisted,2 stars
"Apart from you, you mean?",2 stars
Jambhvan?,2 stars
I almost had him.,2 stars
Hardly even worth it,2 stars
"Half went to Queen Kaushalya,",2 stars
You've leapt so much further,2 stars
We are so similar.,2 stars
Surely this barrier would be no match,2 stars
that hasn't already been done?,2 stars
"Angad, are you...",2 stars
"Oh, that was Jambhvan",2 stars
on the same side for once.,2 stars
"Half went to Queen Kaushalya,",2 stars
"If we don't do his bidding,",2 stars
"Days turned to weeks,",2 stars
We are so similar.,2 stars
I don't think that rock's ever coming down,2 stars
"Oh, that was Jambhvan",2 stars
will be forfeit.,2 stars
They are not at fault. I am,2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
Never better.,2 stars
"Prince Angad, you look thirsty.",2 stars
He has few resources himself,2 stars
but I will not help them,2 stars
You've leapt so much further,2 stars
Meant only for yours truly,2 stars
So much further,2 stars
They're just vines,2 stars
We cannot trust their presence in our,2 stars
"This cannot be a coincidence,",2 stars
will be forfeit.,2 stars
"Something's disturbing you,",2 stars
You are too high,2 stars
And then...,2 stars
If Vaali lost...,2 stars
Then?,2 stars
Weeks? How is that possible?,2 stars
I did not know,2 stars
For Ram lost much that day,2 stars
but no lives will be forfeit.,2 stars
She feeds off her power,2 stars
he would not do for her,2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
Me?,2 stars
"No, Jambhvan!",2 stars
I bet the rakshas has run off,2 stars
She feeds off her power,2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
Then a quarter to Sumitra,2 stars
"He has grown too powerful, Anjana.",2 stars
under his foot,2 stars
"It's over, Sugreev.",2 stars
forgot his promise to Lord Ram...,2 stars
would not have been enough,2 stars
My brother had lost his way.,2 stars
were asked to bring something,2 stars
Did Shurpanakha do something to me?,2 stars
Vaali has been corrupted.,2 stars
"Jambhvan, I don't feel so good...",2 stars
It would tear out his heart.,2 stars
It's trying to eat me.,2 stars
but no lives will be forfeit.,2 stars
When you are so much more,2 stars
The loss of Sita would destroy him.,2 stars
I would have chopped it,2 stars
"Something's disturbing you,",2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
"Yet, a kingdom cannot prosper",2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
"Unhand me, Angad! He's about to...",2 stars
if I'd merely told him,2 stars
They found no trace of Princess Sita,2 stars
I can't contain it,2 stars
upon their throats.,2 stars
"likely to death, for a human.",2 stars
Hardly even worth it,2 stars
when he swings it down on our necks!,2 stars
than a stick and a toy.,2 stars
It wasn't right,2 stars
until they become monsters themselves.,2 stars
I will see him suffer the same pain,2 stars
You've leapt so much further,2 stars
But how? The sea looks endless,2 stars
to the vanadevata? They'll be wiped out.,2 stars
of two such beings,2 stars
"Jambhvan, keep an eye on those two",2 stars
It's not them I'm worried about.,2 stars
He should have returned by now.,2 stars
even though his mind is not,2 stars
Angad can take back the throne,2 stars
weeks to months,2 stars
"Better they be destroyed,",2 stars
Something...,2 stars
soon after,2 stars
"I've tried talking to him,",2 stars
Weeks? How is that possible?,2 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
To lose them both would be unthinkable,2 stars
but no skill in boat-making,2 stars
"We aren't here to hunt demons, Angad.",2 stars
Even now?,2 stars
but I will not help them,2 stars
"Yet, a kingdom cannot prosper",2 stars
it wouldn't stand up against my bow.,2 stars
Never better.,2 stars
No shiny shields or deadly swords.,2 stars
They are not at fault. I am,2 stars
He has that troublesome Jambhvan,2 stars
But no.,2 stars
He has that troublesome Jambhvan,2 stars
He'd already tucked his tail,2 stars
If I had not intervened...,2 stars
I don't know how to save him,2 stars
We don't have that kind of time,2 stars
"I, too, can't do any better",2 stars
I really almost had him,2 stars
Something is weird about this,2 stars
There are voices in the wind,2 stars
Do you... do you hear that?,2 stars
would drink the nectar,2 stars
that hasn't already been done?,2 stars
But his wings were ruthlessly ripped off,2 stars
"And so, we cannot ask for help",2 stars
Hanuman's devotion to Ram is without equal.,2 stars
Never better.,2 stars
soon after,2 stars
"It's over, Sugreev.",2 stars
and its success grows slimmer,2 stars
No shiny shields or deadly swords.,2 stars
"It's almost over, now",2 stars
Better to try something,2 stars
"And then,",2 stars
They could be dangerous.,2 stars
"Unhand me, Angad! He's about to...",2 stars
I would rather die,2 stars
and may soon be extinguished forever.,2 stars
I bet the rakshas has run off,2 stars
I should have followed him,2 stars
It started some time back...,2 stars
under his foot,2 stars
"What, Angad? What?",2 stars
It's over,2 stars
They're not in the right place,2 stars
"He was too stubborn and I couldn't say no,",2 stars
Hanuman's devotion to Ram is without equal.,2 stars
"be so peaceful, so humble?",2 stars
We don't have that kind of time,2 stars
"No, more powerful than him",2 stars
with sadness in her eyes,2 stars
Indra? Agni?,2 stars
Then he took something...,2 stars
I'm worried,2 stars
I am not the warrior he is.,2 stars
since Sita vanished.,2 stars
it burns like the sun,2 stars
He cares too much,2 stars
- We don't have much time,2 stars
I don't know,2 stars
"So, they stole my powers?",2 stars
"Water is not our element, old bear",2 stars
But his wings were ruthlessly ripped off,2 stars
Perhaps you possess something,2 stars
"Angad, I would never!",2 stars
I can't fight this for much longer,2 stars
He should have returned by now.,2 stars
"Few creatures alive could defy him,",2 stars
If Vaali lost...,2 stars
Dangers that would make,2 stars
That is not for me to tell,2 stars
"He could have left me to die,",2 stars
But not here,2 stars
it burns like the sun,2 stars
Hanuman's devotion to Ram is without equal.,2 stars
She feeds off her power,2 stars
There are those that will defy,2 stars
their minds became twisted,2 stars
Something is weird about this,2 stars
until he is dead at my feet.,2 stars
while he crushes Ram's head,2 stars
"for too long, Hanuman",2 stars
to stand by Sugreev?,2 stars
I will see him suffer the same pain,2 stars
were asked to bring something,2 stars
"If we don't do his bidding,",2 stars
But not here,2 stars
Rarely does the Earth see a creature,2 stars
I really almost had him,2 stars
that hasn't already been done?,2 stars
I have to do something.,2 stars
I really almost had him,2 stars
I can't fight this for much longer,2 stars
They could be dangerous.,2 stars
and we have had so little of that,2 stars
And now that time has run out,2 stars
"Mine used to be worse,",2 stars
He does not know the ways of the world,2 stars
"It's almost over, now",2 stars
"Apart from you, you mean?",2 stars
It's too late,2 stars
When you are so much more,2 stars
he would not do for her,2 stars
Did Shurpanakha do something to me?,2 stars
"You think too much of yourself, Ram.",2 stars
then our delay would be,2 stars
They cannot be trusted.,2 stars
lurking nearby or even rakshasas.,2 stars
Or... the day after?,2 stars
Not while I am your leader.,2 stars
In me?,2 stars
Meant only for yours truly,2 stars
They could be dangerous.,2 stars
"For uncountable years,",2 stars
I can't contain it,2 stars
"Jambhvan, keep an eye on those two",2 stars
lurking nearby or even rakshasas.,2 stars
"Wait, Angad.",2 stars
"For a second, I thought his eyes...",2 stars
but no lives will be forfeit.,2 stars
Perhaps you possess something,2 stars
"We aren't here to hunt demons, Angad.",2 stars
Never better.,2 stars
I almost had him.,2 stars
He can't handle the light.,2 stars
"Apart from you, you mean?",2 stars
high? Just a moment. I would've just...,2 stars
"be so peaceful, so humble?",2 stars
if it wasn't for these heroes,2 stars
it wouldn't stand up against my bow.,2 stars
Sugreev? Ruler of the vaanars?,2 stars
I don't understand,2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
Me?,2 stars
Vaali has gone too far,2 stars
Or dumber. I haven't decided yet.,2 stars
"Water is not our element, old bear",2 stars
There is nothing to worry about.,2 stars
to stand by Sugreev?,2 stars
Forgive me... you are quite old.,2 stars
I should have followed him,2 stars
upon their throats.,2 stars
and your voice only makes it worse,2 stars
King Dashrath lacked the one treasure,2 stars
"Old bear, really?",2 stars
Never better.,2 stars
to the vanadevata? They'll be wiped out.,2 stars
They found no trace of Princess Sita,2 stars
He is too easily taken in,2 stars
She is too gentle a soul,2 stars
He'd already tucked his tail,2 stars
she'll be really upset,2 stars
their minds became twisted,2 stars
"You think too much of yourself, Ram.",2 stars
But how? The sea looks endless,2 stars
I couldn't bear to look,2 stars
Hanuman's devotion to Ram is without equal.,2 stars
he would not do for her,2 stars
soon after,2 stars
Too much time has passed,2 stars
I was not ready. That I should first enjoy,2 stars
It's too late,2 stars
I do believe it would have laughed itself,2 stars
would drink the nectar,2 stars
will be unable to resist.,2 stars
Hardly even worth it,2 stars
Vaali has gone too far,2 stars
"You think too much of yourself, Ram.",2 stars
I can't contain it,2 stars
But not here,2 stars
The two Princes are unlike,2 stars
"And then,",2 stars
"If you had come to me,",2 stars
"It's over, Sugreev.",2 stars
thought I was seem insignificant now.,2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
"sea, and there's no other way across it",2 stars
The loss of Sita would destroy him.,2 stars
But not here,2 stars
It's too late,2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
But his wings were ruthlessly ripped off,2 stars
"Instead, sing songs in memory",2 stars
I thought they were merely legends,2 stars
Have you done something with your hair?,2 stars
I think too much sun is affecting,2 stars
I thought they were merely legends,2 stars
were asked to bring something,2 stars
Me?,2 stars
I am not the hero he is.,2 stars
"Half went to Queen Kaushalya,",2 stars
And then the nectar was produced.,2 stars
We searched the city but feared the worst,2 stars
but I will not help them,2 stars
and its success grows slimmer,2 stars
soon after,2 stars
I would rather die,2 stars
He cares too much,2 stars
I have to do something.,2 stars
Meant only for yours truly,2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
Dangers that would make,2 stars

"Mine used to be worse,",2 stars
I almost had him.,2 stars
That is not for me to tell,2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
He should have returned by now.,2 stars
I used to be much worse.,2 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
I would rather die,2 stars
Or dumber. I haven't decided yet.,2 stars
The curse is too strong,2 stars
The soldiers won't like it.,2 stars
it wouldn't stand up against my bow.,2 stars
Lord Sugreev can't hold out much longer,2 stars
"If we don't do his bidding,",2 stars
We are so similar.,2 stars
it burns like the sun,2 stars
growing?,2 stars
but he has left no trail.,2 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
under his foot,2 stars
"And yet, Princess Sita was nowhere",2 stars
"others is not throwing it away, Angad",2 stars
You're too valuable to me.,2 stars
I... I don't understand.,2 stars
part of asura and rakshas ancestry?,2 stars
Something...,2 stars
would not have been enough,2 stars
I don't understand,2 stars
Never better.,2 stars
"Half went to Queen Kaushalya,",2 stars
If I had not intervened...,2 stars
He would rather die than fail him.,2 stars
"Better they be destroyed,",2 stars
"others is not throwing it away, Angad",2 stars
"Mine used to be worse,",2 stars
Then a quarter to Sumitra,2 stars
I used to be much worse.,2 stars
"Wait, if they surround your entire kingdom",2 stars
"For a second, I thought his eyes...",2 stars
And then the nectar was produced.,2 stars
Not so much. Weren't you adopted? Go!,2 stars
But not here,2 stars
thought I was seem insignificant now.,2 stars
"Yet, a kingdom cannot prosper",2 stars
high? Just a moment. I would've just...,2 stars
Maybe they're not home.,2 stars
Hanuman's devotion to Ram is without equal.,2 stars
"Angad, I would never!",2 stars
and thinks only with his mace.,2 stars
I am not fit to face her any more.,2 stars
But his wings were ruthlessly ripped off,2 stars
and your voice only makes it worse,2 stars
Angad can take back the throne,2 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
The two Princes are unlike,2 stars
If I had not intervened...,2 stars
I don't know how to save him,2 stars
"Apart from you, you mean?",2 stars
Something...,2 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
I should have fought harder.,2 stars
"I mean, Jambhvan",2 stars
"If you had come to me,",2 stars
King Dashrath lacked the one treasure,2 stars
"Nal, I'd stop that if I were you.",2 stars
"Without the power of the mahayagna,",2 stars
Sita... Sita...,2 stars
King Dashrath lacked the one treasure,2 stars
would hardly stretch your muscles,2 stars
"We aren't here to hunt demons, Angad.",2 stars
Then?,2 stars
I don't know how to save him,2 stars
I couldn't bear to look,2 stars
They are not at fault. I am,2 stars
But no.,2 stars
are unlike the brutes and outcasts,2 stars
before time runs out,2 stars
I don't know how to save him,2 stars
I don't know how to save him,2 stars
We don't have that kind of time,2 stars
"for too long, Hanuman",2 stars
I... I don't understand.,2 stars
"For a second, I thought his eyes...",2 stars
It wasn't right,2 stars
"He was too stubborn and I couldn't say no,",2 stars
It's trying to eat me.,2 stars
it wouldn't stand up against my bow.,2 stars
it wouldn't stand up against my bow.,2 stars
The pain is too great for him,2 stars
Long enough for him to recover,2 stars
thought I was seem insignificant now.,2 stars
to smile about?,2 stars
I don't know,2 stars
The two Princes are unlike,2 stars
I'm not hungry.,2 stars
I was not expecting to bring you,2 stars
But how? The sea looks endless,2 stars
upon their throats.,2 stars
"that may destroy us.""",2 stars
Do you... do you hear that?,2 stars
to smile about?,2 stars
has corrupted him too much,2 stars
My brother had lost his way.,2 stars
I do not think he will help you.,2 stars
I almost put an arrow through you.,2 stars
Not so much. Weren't you adopted? Go!,2 stars
but I will not help them,2 stars
It's too late,2 stars
to the vanadevata? They'll be wiped out.,2 stars
will not let you down again.,2 stars
after Si... his wife is dead?,2 stars
"Angad, I'm sorry.",2 stars
lurking nearby or even rakshasas.,2 stars
That is not for me to tell,2 stars
They are not at fault. I am,2 stars
with a garland wrapped around my neck?,2 stars
I'm worried,2 stars
I was not expecting to bring you,2 stars
If Vaali lost...,2 stars
Jambhvan?,2 stars
They could be dangerous.,2 stars
They found no trace of Princess Sita,2 stars
But how? The sea looks endless,2 stars
I don't think he is!,2 stars
They look exactly alike.,2 stars
Jambhvan?,2 stars
They are not at fault. I am,2 stars
My mace would snap,2 stars
Weeks? How is that possible?,2 stars
"Without the power of the mahayagna,",2 stars
There are voices in the wind,2 stars
I am getting too old for this.,2 stars
"Jambhvan, am I seeing things or is he...",2 stars
They're not in the right place,2 stars
"Lord Ram is not the man you think, Angad.",2 stars
They could be dangerous.,2 stars
lurking nearby or even rakshasas.,2 stars
He cares too much,2 stars
he should've brought more arrows.,2 stars
"Yet, a kingdom cannot prosper",2 stars
will be unable to resist.,2 stars
Even I don't think so highly of myself,2 stars
Forgive me... you are quite old.,2 stars
"Lord Ram is not the man you think, Angad.",2 stars
You are too high,2 stars
You've leapt so much further,2 stars

"Few creatures alive could defy him,",2 stars
"If you had come to me,",2 stars
But not here,2 stars
upon their throats.,2 stars
But his wings were ruthlessly ripped off,2 stars
Things are worse than my uncle thought,2 stars
It's over,2 stars
That path was made by something big.,2 stars
I haven't been able,2 stars
Sugreev? Ruler of the vaanars?,2 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
You've leapt so much further,2 stars

He would rather die than fail him.,2 stars
It's too late,2 stars
The sun tastes like mango?,2 stars
You've leapt so much further,2 stars
But they were already dead and gone,2 stars
"It's over, Sugreev.",2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
since Sita vanished.,2 stars
You are too high,2 stars
on the same side for once.,2 stars
he should've brought more arrows.,2 stars
It started some time back...,2 stars
Angad can take back the throne,2 stars
I thought they were merely legends,2 stars
It's trying to eat me.,2 stars
And if they turn out to be unreasonable?,2 stars
"Jambhvan, keep an eye on those two",2 stars

I... I don't understand.,2 stars
It wasn't right,2 stars

Hanuman does not consider me,2 stars

Lord Sugreev can't hold out much longer,2 stars
My mace would snap,2 stars
"Wait, if they surround your entire kingdom",2 stars
Looks like they've abandoned the place.,2 stars
"No, more powerful than him",2 stars
"He has grown too powerful, Anjana.",2 stars
That path was made by something big.,2 stars
It started some time back...,2 stars
Across the sea? Then our quest is over,2 stars
Jambhvan? What?,2 stars
Or dumber. I haven't decided yet.,2 stars
I don't know,2 stars
"Two young, strong men",2 stars
Sita... Sita...,2 stars

The reign of Vaali is over.,2 stars

He cares too much,2 stars
I can't contain it,2 stars
weeks to months,2 stars
"And yet, Princess Sita was nowhere",2 stars
Then?,2 stars
"Wait, if they surround your entire kingdom",2 stars
Sugreev? Ruler of the vaanars?,2 stars
Suketu?,2 stars
"Jambhvan, keep an eye on those two",2 stars
"He could have left me to die,",2 stars
and may soon be extinguished forever.,2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
"for too long, Hanuman",2 stars
two different interpretations.,2 stars
It wasn't right,2 stars
"What, Angad? What?",2 stars
We searched the city but feared the worst,2 stars
To lose them both would be unthinkable,2 stars
The pain is too great for him,2 stars
until he is dead at my feet.,2 stars
"Nal, I'd stop that if I were you.",2 stars
"It's not the stars, Jambhvan",2 stars
"Lord Ram is not the man you think, Angad.",2 stars
We are so similar.,2 stars
I have to do something.,2 stars
Hardly even worth it,2 stars
Long enough for him to recover,2 stars
high? Just a moment. I would've just...,2 stars
King Dashrath lacked the one treasure,2 stars
thought I was seem insignificant now.,2 stars
I have to do something.,2 stars
"Instead, sing songs in memory",2 stars
"Angad, I'm sorry.",2 stars
she'll be really upset,2 stars
Hanuman's devotion to Ram is without equal.,2 stars
They cannot be trusted.,2 stars
For Ram lost much that day,2 stars
They cannot be trusted.,2 stars
We cannot trust their presence in our,2 stars
to the vanadevata? They'll be wiped out.,2 stars
I did not. But perhaps their message,2 stars
and we have had so little of that,2 stars
it burns like the sun,2 stars
high? Just a moment. I would've just...,2 stars
"He was not raised to lead others,",2 stars
if it wasn't for these heroes,2 stars
I am not the hero he is.,2 stars
and may soon be extinguished forever.,2 stars
Or dumber. I haven't decided yet.,2 stars
if it wasn't for these heroes,2 stars
Sita... Sita...,2 stars
Looks like they've abandoned the place.,2 stars
Meant only for yours truly,2 stars
They are not at fault. I am,2 stars
When you are so much more,2 stars
They cannot be trusted.,2 stars
"Angad, I would never!",2 stars
"Others, unable to live under his tyranny,",2 stars
with Hanuman?,2 stars
And then the nectar was produced.,2 stars
than a stick and a toy.,2 stars
"Water is not our element, old bear",2 stars
The pain is too great for him,2 stars
I should have followed him,2 stars
How much time?,2 stars
that hasn't already been done?,2 stars
I would rather die,2 stars
lurking nearby or even rakshasas.,2 stars
"that may destroy us.""",2 stars
The pain is too great for him,2 stars
soon after,2 stars
"I had a vision that you were coming,",2 stars
"Something's wrong with me, Jambhvan",2 stars
The sun tastes like mango?,2 stars
"The more you focus on those bad things,",2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
And if they turn out to be unreasonable?,2 stars
but he has left no trail.,2 stars
"Jambhvan, keep an eye on those two",2 stars
I should have followed him,2 stars
I should have fought harder.,2 stars
"I, too, can't do any better",2 stars
"So, they stole my powers?",2 stars
I don't understand.,2 stars
"Jambhvan, I don't feel so good...",2 stars
The sun tastes like mango?,2 stars
"Jambhvan, didn't you hear it?",2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
Or... the day after?,2 stars
It is too high for you and me,2 stars
The curse is too strong,2 stars
It started some time back...,2 stars
But they were already dead and gone,2 stars
were asked to bring something,2 stars
"Angad, are you...",2 stars
When you are so much more,2 stars
Suketu?,2 stars
They're just vines,2 stars
There is something...,2 stars
but I will not help them,2 stars
and its success grows slimmer,2 stars
of two such beings,2 stars
"Angad, I'm sorry.",2 stars
For Ram lost much that day,2 stars
"Nal, I'd stop that if I were you.",2 stars
"likely to death, for a human.",2 stars
"You think too much of yourself, Ram.",2 stars
They look exactly alike.,2 stars
It's too late,2 stars
she'll be really upset,2 stars
But you've left me no choice.,2 stars
while he crushes Ram's head,2 stars
"others is not throwing it away, Angad",2 stars
can also be deadly,2 stars
I will see him suffer the same pain,2 stars
on the same side for once.,2 stars
"likely to death, for a human.",2 stars
it burns like the sun,2 stars
then our delay would be,2 stars
with sadness in her eyes,2 stars
I don't understand,2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
"Days turned to weeks,",2 stars
"Jambhvan, didn't you hear it?",2 stars
#NAME?,2 stars
"It's not the stars, Jambhvan",2 stars
Sugreev? Ruler of the vaanars?,2 stars
If I had not intervened...,2 stars
The sun tastes like mango?,2 stars
even my tail is limp.,2 stars
But what returned was not my brother.,2 stars
"Your memory is short, Hanuman.",2 stars
The two Princes are unlike,2 stars
Lord Sugreev can't hold out much longer,2 stars
their minds became twisted,2 stars
Hanuman does not consider me,2 stars
"Oh, that was Jambhvan",2 stars
that hasn't already been done?,2 stars
soon after,2 stars
Maybe they're not home.,2 stars
Jambhvan? What?,2 stars
their minds became twisted,2 stars
We cannot trust their presence in our,2 stars
That is not for you to decide.,2 stars
My mace would snap,2 stars
"Too bold, by far",2 stars
Even now?,2 stars
and its success grows slimmer,2 stars
"Few creatures alive could defy him,",2 stars
"Jambhvan, am I seeing things or is he...",2 stars
until he is dead at my feet.,2 stars
You are too high,2 stars
"Oh, that was Jambhvan",2 stars
"You think too much of yourself, Ram.",2 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
Hardly even worth it,2 stars
weeks to months,2 stars
Perhaps you possess something,2 stars
Surely this barrier would be no match,2 stars
soon after,2 stars
if it wasn't for these heroes,2 stars
Not so much. Weren't you adopted? Go!,2 stars
He should have returned by now.,2 stars
It might be poisonous,2 stars
"Something's disturbing you,",2 stars
"Angad, I'm sorry.",2 stars
delayed the start of the search.,2 stars
will not let you down again.,2 stars
When you are so much more,2 stars

"It's almost over, now",2 stars
"Your memory is short, Hanuman.",2 stars
"Too bold, by far",2 stars
"others is not throwing it away, Angad",2 stars

But how? The sea looks endless,2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
We cannot trust their presence in our,2 stars
Maybe they're not home.,2 stars
"And yet, Princess Sita was nowhere",2 stars
They cannot be trusted.,2 stars
"It's almost over, now",2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
"Too bold, by far",2 stars
"And so, we cannot ask for help",2 stars
I will see him suffer the same pain,2 stars
"He could have left me to die,",2 stars
Did Shurpanakha do something to me?,2 stars
"Few creatures alive could defy him,",2 stars
I have to do something.,2 stars
Suketu?,2 stars

I am getting too old for this.,2 stars
thought I was seem insignificant now.,2 stars

Sita... Sita...,2 stars

It started some time back...,2 stars
Not so much. Weren't you adopted? Go!,2 stars
Perhaps you possess something,2 stars
but no lives will be forfeit.,2 stars
in the air... The humming noises,2 stars
He can't handle the light.,2 stars
Jambhvan? What?,2 stars
Vaali has been corrupted.,2 stars
"I had a vision that you were coming,",2 stars
I haven't been able,2 stars
You're too valuable to me.,2 stars
since Sita vanished.,2 stars
Never better.,2 stars
then our delay would be,2 stars
will not let you down again.,2 stars
They cannot be trusted.,2 stars
He has that troublesome Jambhvan,2 stars
When you are so much more,2 stars
So much further,2 stars
"Vaali had won,",2 stars

Surely this barrier would be no match,2 stars

Hanuman does not consider me,2 stars
There is something...,2 stars

Suketu?,2 stars
And then the nectar was produced.,2 stars
They're just vines,2 stars
and does not wish to be found.,2 stars
We don't have that kind of time,2 stars
I did not. But perhaps their message,2 stars
But no.,2 stars
He does not know the ways of the world,2 stars
"Days turned to weeks,",2 stars

"I'm sorry, Angad.",2 stars
But what returned was not my brother.,2 stars
So much further,2 stars
Perhaps you possess something,2 stars
on the same side for once.,2 stars
That was Angad!,2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
Hardly even worth it,2 stars
I think too much sun is affecting,2 stars
"I mean, Jambhvan",2 stars
I sensed as much,2 stars
We searched the city but feared the worst,2 stars
"So, they stole my powers?",2 stars
when he swings it down on our necks!,2 stars
Then?,2 stars
We don't have that kind of time,2 stars
You will not understand the burden,2 stars
will not let you down again.,2 stars
My brother had lost his way.,2 stars
Jambhvan?,2 stars
Indra? Agni?,2 stars

It's over,2 stars
Vaali has been corrupted.,2 stars
upon their throats.,2 stars
He'd already tucked his tail,2 stars
I have to do something.,2 stars
I don't think he is!,2 stars
You will not understand the burden,2 stars

My ideas?,2 stars
"I've tried talking to him,",2 stars
Me?,2 stars
"Apart from you, you mean?",2 stars
"I, too, can't do any better",2 stars
You became no different from Ravan.,2 stars
it burns like the sun,2 stars
"for too long, Hanuman",2 stars
"Few creatures alive could defy him,",2 stars
The reign of Vaali is over.,2 stars
Forgive me... you are quite old.,2 stars
"Others, unable to live under his tyranny,",2 stars

Hanuman? Jambhvan?,2 stars
"Apart from you, you mean?",2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
I should have followed him,2 stars

Maybe they're not home.,2 stars
with sadness in her eyes,2 stars
lurking nearby or even rakshasas.,2 stars
The wind's too loud!,2 stars
No shiny shields or deadly swords.,2 stars
The loss of Sita would destroy him.,2 stars
It's trying to eat me.,2 stars
Dharini? Kandarpa?,2 stars
I do not think he will help you.,2 stars

Indra? Agni?,2 stars
"likely to death, for a human.",2 stars
"Wait, Angad.",2 stars
"It is not just for that reason, Vaali.",2 stars
It would tear out his heart.,2 stars
The soldiers won't like it.,2 stars
The soldiers won't like it.,2 stars
He is too easily taken in,2 stars
I don't know how to save him,2 stars
She is too gentle a soul,2 stars
Not while I am your leader.,2 stars

How much time?,2 stars

I used to be much worse.,2 stars

I was not expecting to bring you,2 stars

There is nothing to worry about.,2 stars

I was not ready. That I should first enjoy,2 stars
I used to be much worse.,2 stars
They're not in the right place,2 stars
Something is weird about this,2 stars

"Days turned to weeks,",2 stars
I almost had him.,2 stars
"Jambhvan, I don't feel so good...",2 stars
"Instead, sing songs in memory",2 stars
I'm getting too old for this,2 stars
Not if I get it first,2 stars
until he is dead at my feet.,2 stars
"Oh, that was Jambhvan",2 stars
They look exactly alike.,2 stars
"Lord Ram is not the man you think, Angad.",2 stars
Something...,2 stars
#NAME?,2 stars
"Nal, I'd stop that if I were you.",2 stars
The soldiers won't like it.,2 stars
Vaali is too powerful.,2 stars
That was Angad!,2 stars
That is not for me to tell,2 stars
and we have had so little of that,2 stars
but no skill in boat-making,2 stars
under his foot,2 stars
That is not for you to decide.,2 stars
Shurpanakha would have killed me,2 stars
if I'd merely told him,2 stars
Across the sea? Then our quest is over,2 stars
Sita... Sita...,2 stars
But how? The sea looks endless,2 stars
"For uncountable years,",2 stars
I do not think he will help you.,2 stars
on the same side for once.,2 stars
their minds became twisted,2 stars
I will see him suffer the same pain,2 stars
But that is the way,3 stars
"Angad, please...",3 stars
But how?,3 stars
Does Hanuman think he's better than you?,3 stars
Is that why Sugreev picked us?,3 stars
"As I said, we're a lot alike.",3 stars
Is that why Sugreev picked us?,3 stars
But to show mercy,3 stars
"Are you sure you're up for this, Jambhvan?",3 stars
He doesn't know who he's fighting,3 stars
but now...,3 stars
"Angad, please...",3 stars
Is that all you've got?,3 stars
"So that, in death, you may find peace.",3 stars
"You, however, seem trapped here...",3 stars
It's bone.,3 stars
"Yes, I understand. But how?",3 stars
You want me gone to make sure Vaali's,3 stars
If we fail to find Princess Sita,3 stars
it has been many moons,3 stars
Perhaps we could have Sampati search Lanka,3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
"Yes, you do, but never alone.",3 stars
I hear it. Over there,3 stars
All you've done is complain,3 stars
to fetch it for her.,3 stars
the sun tastes a bit like a mango?,3 stars
You misunderstand,3 stars
I don't know which to believe,3 stars
for not stopping you,3 stars
Is that so?,3 stars
"Let's find Princess Sita first, yes?",3 stars
We have a problem,3 stars
Angad!,3 stars
I see shining waves,3 stars
You did...,3 stars
"If you fail to bring me Ram,",3 stars
But when the years of penance,3 stars
"I found the anklet upon a tree branch,",3 stars
"But being beside my brother,",3 stars
"If I had known whose it was, my Prince,",3 stars
Though I doubt any rakshas would be,3 stars
We may be able to help him.,3 stars
he needed his kingdom back.,3 stars
Shurpanakha? The sister of Ravan?,3 stars
"But, Hanuman...",3 stars
Is that what I should have done?,3 stars
Have some more water,3 stars
you have to convince Suketu,3 stars
"But not before a small bird,",3 stars
I am far-sighted,3 stars
But you'd never even get close,3 stars
Try me.,3 stars
Perhaps he is wise enough,3 stars
but to show mercy,3 stars
"Then, I will crush his bones.",3 stars
But Ram was determined,3 stars
if Princess Sita cannot be found.,3 stars
yet my brother swatted them aside,3 stars
Let me get some sleep.,3 stars
You know there is more,3 stars
"Well, those were some weird talking birds",3 stars
"Well, those were some weird talking birds",3 stars
We should wait,3 stars
If only to shut you up.,3 stars
If you need my help...,3 stars
They'll get lost in the caves,3 stars
"Despite my age,",3 stars
if Princess Sita cannot be found.,3 stars
I have to test it out.,3 stars
when we first encountered Shurpanakha,3 stars
He is young and inexperienced.,3 stars
"If not them, then who?",3 stars
Do you wish,3 stars
He is young and inexperienced.,3 stars
What? But you challenged Vaali,3 stars
but he is not wise like you.,3 stars
are made of lesser material.,3 stars
What? I'm sure I'm most delicious.,3 stars
"Okay, now time for bed",3 stars
It would be best to send,3 stars
I am but a humble sage,3 stars
but I will help the vaanars,3 stars
Ravan had but one desire.,3 stars
Perhaps he'll forgive us,3 stars
Like what?,3 stars
Let me try some healing spells,3 stars
I needed to learn whether you were a friend,3 stars
"Meanwhile, the celebrations continued",3 stars
Some more water then,3 stars
but he could not leave it at that.,3 stars
"I'll be fine, Angad",3 stars
then we'll need boats,3 stars
But will his followers respect him?,3 stars
Just a bit more,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
"I'm sorry, Hanuman, but I've made up my mind",3 stars
The crown is a heavier burden,3 stars
Though the two Princes had been led astray,3 stars
But what do you offer in return?,3 stars
It means it's all over,3 stars
But you're brothers.,3 stars
You've done enough,3 stars
We would rather tell Sugreev himself.,3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
We have a problem,3 stars
You on the other hand?,3 stars
But their light has become faint,3 stars
Can you understand that?,3 stars
after all that has happened?,3 stars
That is why,3 stars
that I can't see,3 stars
"But not enough for two, I'm afraid",3 stars
"Then, I will reason with this.",3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
"If you are my father, then please...",3 stars
I am but a humble sage,3 stars
done with it?,3 stars
Have you quite finished?,3 stars
"But, King Suketu, he needs us",3 stars
You are looking at the Vaalakhilya,3 stars
That must be why,3 stars
Let me try some healing spells,3 stars
Only I'm allowed to do that,3 stars
"I know, but it's time we prepare.",3 stars
Do you wish to have your worth measured?,3 stars
Try me.,3 stars
I see swift free-jumping creatures,3 stars
I don't know if I can help now,3 stars
Despite the costs.,3 stars
but he grew enamoured with this woman.,3 stars
"Sometimes, we have no choice",3 stars
He has redeemed me.,3 stars
"Yes, but you don't understand...",3 stars
"Less flattery, more work!",3 stars
And that is something,3 stars
Mayavi's evil needed to end.,3 stars
"I bet you have a temper like me, too.",3 stars
"You can almost smell it,",3 stars
Or does my bow need to sing,3 stars
"to find the wise Sugreev,",3 stars
I bet there are juicy berries,3 stars
It'll only take a few minutes,3 stars
"well, I would have torn it in two.",3 stars
The vines are growing stronger,3 stars
"For many, there is no hope that",3 stars
You are looking at the Vaalakhilya,3 stars
still lies ahead,3 stars
Though you already know the answer,3 stars
"Sometimes, we have no choice",3 stars
"But then again,",3 stars
"So, do you accept my challenge, hero?",3 stars
I thought that was the home,3 stars
"Only the fortitude, numbers",3 stars
I do not know why Lord Sugreev,3 stars
"So, you decided to join us, eh?",3 stars
"If we are loyal to each other,",3 stars
Is that why Sugreev picked us?,3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
Then it's okay.,3 stars
Perhaps someone else can go,3 stars
He needs you,3 stars
You want me gone to make sure Vaali's,3 stars
Perhaps someone else can go,3 stars
May I ask why?,3 stars
"Perhaps you should resume your mahayagna,",3 stars
Maybe we would have found Princess Sita,3 stars
Princess Sita is on the far side of this,3 stars
But Princess Sita was nowhere,3 stars
But are you prepared for the price?,3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
"I know how you feel, Angad,",3 stars
little one,3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
"So, they came to your home",3 stars
but to take a life.,3 stars
enough to try.,3 stars
May I ask why?,3 stars
"Ma, I'm scared. What's happening?",3 stars
Of course.,3 stars
"I'll be fine, Angad",3 stars
"If you say so, Hanuman, but...",3 stars
"So, it is the demon king",3 stars
Has Hanuman returned from the south?,3 stars
Shurpanakha? The sister of Ravan?,3 stars
"Angad, are you all right?",3 stars
"Yes, you do, but never alone.",3 stars
You did...,3 stars
We don't know what we're up against,3 stars
Though he doesn't yet realize it,3 stars
That must be why,3 stars
but that won't be enough,3 stars
And that is something,3 stars
"For some, such knowledge can destroy them",3 stars
We have to help him.,3 stars
It's almost like it let us inside,3 stars
"If we are loyal to each other,",3 stars
Let me just rest for a while,3 stars
I just hope he discovers it in time,3 stars
"Yet, beauty is not frail.",3 stars
What kind of birds are those?,3 stars
"So, you're the little monkey",3 stars
Or so it would seem,3 stars
Did you know,3 stars
"But, first, we must destroy these vines",3 stars
Ravan,3 stars
they could be found,3 stars
Shurpanakha? The sister of Ravan?,3 stars
"Meanwhile, the celebrations continued",3 stars
And that is something,3 stars
But what do you offer in return?,3 stars
but belong to the same sky.,3 stars
If we don't find Princess Sita,3 stars
You hesitate to face Vaali,3 stars
We were supposed to find her by now,3 stars
"So, why don't you do us the honour",3 stars
Will you look at that?,3 stars
We do not know where Princess Sita is,3 stars
"Fun? If this is fun,",3 stars
Despite the costs.,3 stars
"If you take me to him,",3 stars
"If I had known whose it was, my Prince,",3 stars
"I am moved by your story,",3 stars
to chase what? A cloud?,3 stars
Perhaps you could be as well.,3 stars
but to raise you up,3 stars
have to say.,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
We'll have the Princess back,3 stars
yet my brother swatted them aside,3 stars
"If I am as you say, you may not like",3 stars
I am but a humble sage,3 stars
at last?,3 stars
"in my forest, little monkey?",3 stars
but belong to the same sky.,3 stars
before we attract the attention,3 stars
Though you already know the answer,3 stars
Sugreev.,3 stars
but jumping,3 stars
"I'll try, but this is different",3 stars
to different beings.,3 stars
"So, it is the demon king",3 stars
But there are many types of families.,3 stars
if we must.,3 stars
But I would expect no less,3 stars
Each was given a portion,3 stars
he decided that the only way to show,3 stars
But there are many types of families.,3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
That must be why,3 stars
"I found the anklet upon a tree branch,",3 stars
Perhaps he is wise enough,3 stars
did something to him.,3 stars
But what...,3 stars
You could have been the hurricane,3 stars
Older,3 stars
"then you may escape from Lakshman's arrows,",3 stars
he had not overcome,3 stars
If that's what you wish!,3 stars
"For many, there is no hope that",3 stars
"You seem troubled, my friend",3 stars
I just hope he discovers it in time,3 stars
since they were fed.,3 stars
"Do you think he's right, brother?",3 stars
My brother was always too bold,3 stars
The last portion,3 stars
"However, your story is not one of failure.",3 stars
We should wait,3 stars
Okay! I can shorten our story,3 stars
But if you choose to lay down,3 stars
But when the years of penance,3 stars
Will he be able to lead them?,3 stars
That no matter how dark the night...,3 stars
"I will need to take some of your strength,",3 stars
"than just our lives, Angad",3 stars
"than boat-building, it's swimming",3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
Do you think otherwise?,3 stars
If we fail to find Princess Sita,3 stars
when I needed them?,3 stars
"I have few blessings, vaanar",3 stars
But to show mercy,3 stars
But you're brothers.,3 stars
It would have to be one,3 stars
but to raise you up,3 stars
"We go to him for aid, but we offer him",3 stars
"Perhaps I should go with them,",3 stars
I see shining waves,3 stars
I... There is.,3 stars
"If I may ask,",3 stars
"that, as long as I stand",3 stars
"we're different, Hanuman.",3 stars
But Ram was determined,3 stars
"Women don't age, kind sir",3 stars
Since he thought,3 stars
for his vaanars could help find,3 stars
"to that, we may all be in trouble.",3 stars
"If anything happens to me,",3 stars
Perhaps I just need a bit of a walk.,3 stars
"Less flattery, more work!",3 stars
Does he look like he needs help?,3 stars
It's Hanuman,3 stars
That is enough!,3 stars
"also known as rakshas Maya,",3 stars
"Perhaps, for the first time,",3 stars
"Yet, there is not a night that passes when",3 stars
We have to help him.,3 stars
"by a mere rakshas,",3 stars
Then who will tell me?,3 stars
You on the other hand?,3 stars
And perhaps there is more to myself.,3 stars
But what...,3 stars
for not stopping you,3 stars
"But in killing the demon Maricha,",3 stars
Are you sure?,3 stars
"Fun? If this is fun,",3 stars
but to show mercy,3 stars
We would rather tell Sugreev himself.,3 stars
are made of lesser material.,3 stars
Like what?,3 stars
"Perhaps I should go with them,",3 stars
if Princess Sita cannot be found.,3 stars
"Are you sure you're up for this, Jambhvan?",3 stars
"But, in the end, it will kill him",3 stars
will be preceded by much suffering.,3 stars
Princess Sita's? But why?,3 stars
But are you prepared for the price?,3 stars
"For some, such knowledge can destroy them",3 stars
Do you think he'll help us?,3 stars
Hold on. Where's Lanka?,3 stars
"So, they came to your home",3 stars
"Sometimes, we have no choice",3 stars
There are many,3 stars
It wasn't Sugreev,3 stars
"If not them, then who?",3 stars
The more the merrier,3 stars
That and more lie ahead,3 stars
but you're starting to sound a bit cra...,3 stars
"So, when Princess Sita asked him",3 stars
Her name is Ruma.,3 stars
But I don't know what.,3 stars
"There may be a way,",3 stars
Sugreev.,3 stars
"But not before a small bird,",3 stars
"Though exiled in the forest,",3 stars
There are many,3 stars
Though it might help,3 stars
Think you can do it?,3 stars
"Yes, of course.",3 stars
"Yes, but you don't understand...",3 stars
in case Mayavi somehow found a way back.,3 stars
My head is pounding for some reason,3 stars
She is in Lanka,3 stars
"I have few blessings, vaanar",3 stars
this whole story would be different,3 stars
I thought as much,3 stars
"Meanwhile, the celebrations continued",3 stars
"But by aspiring to be like him,",3 stars
It'll only take a few minutes,3 stars
to be found in the east,3 stars
"than boat-building, it's swimming",3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
"King Sugreev,",3 stars
Jatayu,3 stars
that is your mission.,3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
But if you choose to lay down,3 stars
"However, he will tire of her soon enough,",3 stars
"Though you have no malice in you,",3 stars
"This is a matter between kings,",3 stars
But not nearly on the level of her brother,3 stars
"brief though it is,",3 stars
that may surprise you,3 stars
Probably to discuss,3 stars
Jatayu,3 stars
But Sugreev is in hiding,3 stars
if we must.,3 stars
"If you fail to bring me Ram,",3 stars
"Nevertheless, you are my family.",3 stars
enough to try.,3 stars
There is a darker history,3 stars
Yes. I'm afraid there's no way in or out,3 stars
He only did what was necessary.,3 stars
or foe to my Lord Sugreev.,3 stars
Does Sugreev even have enough monkeys,3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
the mighty Vaali could have defeated...,3 stars
Yes. He has changed,3 stars
"Well, those were some weird talking birds",3 stars
Does Sugreev even have enough monkeys,3 stars
"Only the fortitude, numbers",3 stars
You don't see the potential in it,3 stars
Something like that,3 stars
"If the reward is freedom, then yes",3 stars
But that's not for me,3 stars
"I'm not so fragile, Angad",3 stars
Perhaps we could have Sampati search Lanka,3 stars
that sits in the heart,3 stars
but the decision is yours alone.,3 stars
"I have few blessings, vaanar",3 stars
But when the years of penance,3 stars
but they shattered,3 stars
Hold on. Where's Lanka?,3 stars
Let me at least try to help fix it,3 stars
They are telling me something,3 stars
but that won't be enough,3 stars
It's lucky it died when it did.,3 stars
did something to him.,3 stars
You hesitate to face Vaali,3 stars
may also be the only one,3 stars
perhaps we have been stuck here so long,3 stars
"But he is in pain, Jambhvan",3 stars
But you are wrong.,3 stars
See how they talk behind your back?,3 stars
Just a bit more,3 stars
He does not know whose Pushpak Viman it was,3 stars
"Angad, please...",3 stars
I see much has changed in Kishkindha,3 stars
We don't know what we're up against,3 stars
Only we can stop them.,3 stars
Some more water then,3 stars
It is up to you to decide,3 stars
That... I do hear,3 stars
when we first encountered Shurpanakha,3 stars
"I'll be fine, Angad",3 stars
but our helplessness.,3 stars
"Fun? If this is fun,",3 stars
"then you may escape from Lakshman's arrows,",3 stars
"Now, that's not something you see",3 stars
Just a bit more,3 stars
"If not them, then who?",3 stars
"than boat-building, it's swimming",3 stars
and Ram would have remained happy,3 stars
"But, in the end, it will kill him",3 stars
Okay! I can shorten our story,3 stars
it will take a few days to hear the telling,3 stars
to different beings.,3 stars
I could be quick to anger.,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
My feet ache and look...,3 stars
this whole story would be different,3 stars
He only did what was necessary.,3 stars
"So, you end up inflicting it",3 stars
little one,3 stars
"Sometimes, we have no choice",3 stars
"But not before a small bird,",3 stars
"Sooner, if possible!",3 stars
in case Mayavi somehow found a way back.,3 stars
But you are wrong.,3 stars
"It's okay, little one It's okay",3 stars
it has been many moons,3 stars
Some truths must be revealed,3 stars
Then it's okay.,3 stars
"But first, King Sugreev,",3 stars
"But by aspiring to be like him,",3 stars
My head is pounding for some reason,3 stars
"So, they came to your home",3 stars
She is in Lanka,3 stars
Let me at least try to help fix it,3 stars
Let me gather some supplies,3 stars
There are other ways,3 stars
"Though exiled in the forest,",3 stars
Then who will tell me?,3 stars
the sun tastes a bit like a mango?,3 stars
for Princess Sita?,3 stars
Whoever it is can wait.,3 stars
"You can almost smell it,",3 stars
"than boat-building, it's swimming",3 stars
Though the price was high,3 stars
Sugreev's burdens are heavy.,3 stars
"But, Ma, wait. Which wolf wins?",3 stars
this whole story would be different,3 stars
"Do you challenge me, monkey?",3 stars
We have a problem,3 stars
"Fun? If this is fun,",3 stars
Then we need to be stronger as well,3 stars
"for not confronting you earlier,",3 stars
Did you know,3 stars
"I didn't at first, but it wouldn't have",3 stars
"For many, there is no hope that",3 stars
Maybe you'll learn something,3 stars
"But, first, tell me everything",3 stars
"If I may ask,",3 stars
"So, you're the little monkey",3 stars
"then you may escape from Lakshman's arrows,",3 stars
Probably to discuss,3 stars
Sugreev's burdens are heavy.,3 stars
Though you already know the answer,3 stars
I thought it was a dream,3 stars
Perhaps he is wise enough,3 stars
are made of lesser material.,3 stars
"King Sugreev,",3 stars
but she underestimated me,3 stars
"So, do you accept my challenge, hero?",3 stars
then at least we can get some help,3 stars
doesn't just protect his kingdom,3 stars
Rishyamukh.,3 stars
this Sugreev's other burdens.,3 stars
"Sometimes, we have no choice",3 stars
"to where she may be,",3 stars
We're just in a dark forest,3 stars
Maybe there was.,3 stars
"Perhaps, old bear. But if so,",3 stars
But their light has become faint,3 stars
"The challenge is finished, Angad.",3 stars
It's lucky it died when it did.,3 stars
"But, in the end, it will kill him",3 stars
I was wondering,3 stars
to chase what? A cloud?,3 stars
But that is the way,3 stars
"However, he will tire of her soon enough,",3 stars
but he could not leave it at that.,3 stars
But what do you offer in return?,3 stars
I thought as much,3 stars
She does have a point,3 stars
There are other ways,3 stars
for Princess Sita?,3 stars
But will his followers respect him?,3 stars
She... she...,3 stars
"If anything happens to me,",3 stars
for his vaanars could help find,3 stars
"I used to be quite the fighter, you know.",3 stars
"Yet, I do envy them.",3 stars
But he is still my brother.,3 stars
"But, first, we must destroy these vines",3 stars
"Tell me, Angad",3 stars
"Though I can't bear your burden as a king,",3 stars
but belong to the same sky.,3 stars
"Despite being brothers,",3 stars
"Fun? If this is fun,",3 stars
Since he thought,3 stars
A feast? You'd be the most meagre,3 stars
then that means...,3 stars
"I am moved by your story,",3 stars
"But please, we don't have much time",3 stars
I don't know which to believe,3 stars
"But, first, tell me everything",3 stars
Will he be able to lead them?,3 stars
"If the reward is freedom, then yes",3 stars
Let me try some healing spells,3 stars
as though they were stalks of wheat.,3 stars
I managed to talk some sense,3 stars
"But, as a child, you did not understand",3 stars
Vishnu knew that if the asuras,3 stars
"Yes, you do, but never alone.",3 stars
where Ravan was seen heading,3 stars
"If Jatayu is no more,",3 stars
King Sugreev.,3 stars
It'll only take a few minutes,3 stars
Is that so?,3 stars
"Though you have no malice in you,",3 stars
"for not confronting you earlier,",3 stars
was given again to Sumitra,3 stars
"to where she may be,",3 stars
I see swift free-jumping creatures,3 stars
It's not that far,3 stars
Yesterday perhaps,3 stars
but you weren't yourself,3 stars
Or so it would seem,3 stars
It wasn't Sugreev,3 stars
"So, when Princess Sita asked him",3 stars
The noble Jatayu had witnessed the crime,3 stars
He needs you,3 stars
after all that has happened?,3 stars
I managed to talk some sense,3 stars
"The strong take from the weak,",3 stars
"If we are loyal to each other,",3 stars
"And free of thought, too, apparently.",3 stars
We'll find another way,3 stars
The honour of Kishkindha depends on it.,3 stars
Let me just rest for a while,3 stars
You on the other hand?,3 stars
Some more water then,3 stars
The last portion,3 stars
if we must.,3 stars
"I am moved by your story,",3 stars
it will take a few days to hear the telling,3 stars
You did...,3 stars
"are different,",3 stars
Princess Sita? Are you sure?,3 stars
I see much has changed in Kishkindha,3 stars
Please help me,3 stars
"I've always been on your side, Angad.",3 stars
Maybe you'll learn something,3 stars
Does Sugreev even have enough monkeys,3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
meagre as they are. You'll find nothing.,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
"You can almost smell it,",3 stars
You need to help Angad,3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
It is up to you to decide,3 stars
I could be impulsive.,3 stars
"I'll try, but this is different",3 stars
There are many,3 stars
or foe to my Lord Sugreev.,3 stars
I just hope he discovers it in time,3 stars
but to show mercy,3 stars
Sugreev.,3 stars
"Then later, when my grandson, Maricha,",3 stars
"I know it seems hopeless,",3 stars
"In their ignorance, they might confuse you",3 stars
She is in Lanka,3 stars
Did you know some say,3 stars
"Maybe you were right, Hanuman.",3 stars
little one,3 stars
"Yet, you wish the great Sugreev",3 stars
We would rather tell Sugreev himself.,3 stars
"Perhaps, we can find some way",3 stars
"But being beside my brother,",3 stars
but his heart is his weakness.,3 stars
Is that what I should have done?,3 stars
we have to save Angad,3 stars
Perhaps he does,3 stars
Do you wish to have your worth measured?,3 stars
My head is pounding for some reason,3 stars
You are looking at the Vaalakhilya,3 stars
We should wait,3 stars
and yet found no trace of her,3 stars
little one,3 stars
Maybe you'll learn something,3 stars
it seems.,3 stars
See how they talk behind your back?,3 stars
You've done enough,3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
things would have been different.,3 stars
Which means...,3 stars
"But tell me,",3 stars
"What's the plan, Hanuman?",3 stars
Of course,3 stars
That is why,3 stars
Friendship?,3 stars
Like what?,3 stars
at last?,3 stars
The same fight is also going on,3 stars
Which means...,3 stars
Perhaps he'll forgive us,3 stars
"So, we must be more cunning.",3 stars
have to say.,3 stars
But I want to help them,3 stars
The vines are growing stronger,3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
You know there is more,3 stars
"But being beside my brother,",3 stars
Then it's okay.,3 stars
"that, as long as I stand",3 stars
but he is not wise like you.,3 stars
we might be able to sail across,3 stars
Perhaps someone else can go,3 stars
"I bet you have a temper like me, too.",3 stars
"than boat-building, it's swimming",3 stars
So what brings you so deep into the forest?,3 stars
"but, after meeting you, I feel whole.",3 stars
We'll see about that,3 stars
But the rakshasas are your enemy.,3 stars
but it would have a high cost,3 stars
It'll only take a few minutes,3 stars
you have to choose,3 stars
We'll find the armlet.,3 stars
but you're starting to sound a bit cra...,3 stars
Or so it would seem,3 stars
But you're unarmed.,3 stars
And that is something,3 stars
but he is not wise like you.,3 stars
after all he's done to you?,3 stars
There could be spies of my brother,3 stars
Okay! I can shorten our story,3 stars
But Princess Sita was nowhere,3 stars
"So that, in death, you may find peace.",3 stars
when we first encountered Shurpanakha,3 stars
But this is more,3 stars
You did...,3 stars
Her name is Ruma.,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
"So that, in death, you may find peace.",3 stars
Princess Sita's? But why?,3 stars
It's bone.,3 stars
"Ma, I'm scared. What's happening?",3 stars
"However, the arrival of the monsoon",3 stars
We were supposed to find her by now,3 stars
Sugreev sent us on a mission,3 stars
My brother was always too bold,3 stars
You misunderstand,3 stars
"Yes, but he has been punished",3 stars
Just a bit more,3 stars
"What's the plan, Hanuman?",3 stars
"Perhaps, for the first time,",3 stars
That's Swayamprabha,3 stars
We may be able to help him.,3 stars
That is why,3 stars
Let me gather some supplies,3 stars
Perhaps he does,3 stars
"As I said, we're a lot alike.",3 stars
or the agents of Vaali.,3 stars
There is a king nearby,3 stars
He asked his brother,3 stars
It's just I'm not sure I can do this,3 stars
Maybe he can help us?,3 stars
But this is more,3 stars
"I know how you feel, Angad,",3 stars
Ravan.,3 stars
The last portion,3 stars
Ma!,3 stars
"If not them, then who?",3 stars
but that won't be enough,3 stars
The rakshas had the blood,3 stars
I didn't save Angad; Hanuman did,3 stars
That's easy. The one you feed,3 stars
Think you can do it?,3 stars
What? I'm sure I'm most delicious.,3 stars
If we are to hold this girl's hands,3 stars
A sleeping spell will allow him to rest,3 stars
What does the young monkey mean by that?,3 stars
"by a mere rakshas,",3 stars
but you weren't yourself,3 stars
But what do you offer in return?,3 stars
"The strong take from the weak,",3 stars
"Nevertheless, you are my family.",3 stars
They'll get lost in the caves,3 stars
You know there is more,3 stars
"than just our lives, Angad",3 stars
"Yes, I understand. But how?",3 stars
"Yet, there is not a night that passes when",3 stars
It would be best to send,3 stars
"So, Vaali took the crown",3 stars
"As I said, we're a lot alike.",3 stars
My feet ache and look...,3 stars
"That arrow did not just kill him,",3 stars
may not be as powerful as we...,3 stars
"But, Ma, wait. Which wolf wins?",3 stars
The vaanars should have been,3 stars
But Ram was determined,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
for I'm older and wiser,3 stars
if we must.,3 stars
"Yes, of course.",3 stars
If only...,3 stars
would be a dish,3 stars
It is up to you to decide,3 stars
to different beings.,3 stars
It is up to you to decide,3 stars
Or find Princess Sita,3 stars
You don't see the potential in it,3 stars
But he is still my brother.,3 stars
"I knew you would help us,",3 stars
Sugreev.,3 stars
"But, in the end, it will kill him",3 stars
We're almost there.,3 stars
"also known as rakshas Maya,",3 stars
"than just our lives, Angad",3 stars
"Nevertheless, you are my family.",3 stars
But do not fear;,3 stars
The vines are growing stronger,3 stars
"in the east, west or north",3 stars
We have to help him.,3 stars
you have to convince Suketu,3 stars
May I ask why?,3 stars
But how?,3 stars
that took me,3 stars
"I am moved by your story,",3 stars
You can hide outside if you wish,3 stars
He only did what was necessary.,3 stars
But he is still my brother.,3 stars
but it would have a high cost,3 stars
as though they were stalks of wheat.,3 stars
can be tricky.,3 stars
"Well, those were some weird talking birds",3 stars
"We go to him for aid, but we offer him",3 stars
He has been corrupted by Patal magic,3 stars
that took me,3 stars
Time passed while we were in the cave,3 stars
I am but a humble sage,3 stars
we might be able to sail across,3 stars
"If anything happens to me,",3 stars
enough to try.,3 stars
"If the reward is freedom, then yes",3 stars
"If we start with something simple,",3 stars
that took me,3 stars
But he is still my brother.,3 stars
Ravan.,3 stars
Did you know,3 stars
But my knees should be just fine,3 stars
Ma!,3 stars
after all he's done to you?,3 stars
The same fight is also going on,3 stars
"Less flattery, more work!",3 stars
as though they were stalks of wheat.,3 stars
But he told me a true vaanar,3 stars
"Tell me, Angad",3 stars
"""My friend""?",3 stars
"Are you sure you're up for this, Jambhvan?",3 stars
I bet there are juicy berries,3 stars
We will halt here for rest,3 stars
leads only to destruction.,3 stars
"King Sugreev gave us a mission, Angad.",3 stars
"We Vaalakhilya might be small,",3 stars
but by the demon king himself.,3 stars
Only we can stop them.,3 stars
"So, they came to your home",3 stars
That is enough!,3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
Ravan,3 stars
Perhaps they are merely lost.,3 stars
"I found the anklet upon a tree branch,",3 stars
when I needed them?,3 stars
"And free of thought, too, apparently.",3 stars
Maybe he can help us?,3 stars
but our helplessness.,3 stars
A feast? You'd be the most meagre,3 stars
Maybe we would have found Princess Sita,3 stars
Destined to be the mother,3 stars
Do you know how to find Sugreev?,3 stars
Anjana?,3 stars
"Easy, Angad. I saw you were awake",3 stars
"So, you end up inflicting it",3 stars
What does the young monkey mean by that?,3 stars
found the sight of us amusing,3 stars
but jumping,3 stars
Maybe.,3 stars
He doesn't know what he does.,3 stars
Try me.,3 stars
Though the price was high,3 stars
Perhaps they are merely lost.,3 stars
But that is the way,3 stars
What? I'm sure I'm most delicious.,3 stars
"Yet, I do envy them.",3 stars
But do not fear;,3 stars
May I ask why?,3 stars
Is that all you've got?,3 stars
"In their ignorance, they might confuse you",3 stars
Do you think a few mangy rakshasas,3 stars
You look different,3 stars
Ma!,3 stars
Ready?,3 stars
as though they were stalks of wheat.,3 stars
We should wait,3 stars
the sun tastes a bit like a mango?,3 stars
"I am moved by your story,",3 stars
You're probably at least five times my age,3 stars
"I'm sorry, Hanuman, but I've made up my mind",3 stars
that was destined to lead our people,3 stars
Perhaps we could have Sampati search Lanka,3 stars
But why?,3 stars
But you're brothers.,3 stars
"If he's not freed soon,",3 stars
but he could not leave it at that.,3 stars
"If I shoot, I might kill Sugreev.",3 stars
My head is pounding for some reason,3 stars
That there is more to you,3 stars
"Angad, what's happened to you?",3 stars
"So, when Princess Sita asked him",3 stars
"Actually, I'm probably more like you.",3 stars
"But, as a child, you did not understand",3 stars
We'll have the Princess back,3 stars
Perhaps I just need a bit of a walk.,3 stars
What? But you challenged Vaali,3 stars
You want me gone to make sure Vaali's,3 stars
"than boat-building, it's swimming",3 stars
"Hanuman, if we go to Rikshabila,",3 stars
we have to save Angad,3 stars
I see the elements at war,3 stars
what is your first impression?,3 stars
Will he be able to lead them?,3 stars
Or find Princess Sita,3 stars
"We go to him for aid, but we offer him",3 stars
I have to test it out.,3 stars
Do you wish,3 stars
"So, it is decided!",3 stars
"If Jatayu is no more,",3 stars
That's Swayamprabha,3 stars
where Ravan was seen heading,3 stars
Older,3 stars
It's telling me of a mantra,3 stars
Do you think a few mangy rakshasas,3 stars
If we don't find Princess Sita,3 stars
"Are you sure you're up for this, Jambhvan?",3 stars
I've become a better man,3 stars
A feast? You'd be the most meagre,3 stars
We're just in a dark forest,3 stars
Ma!,3 stars
Shurpanakha,3 stars
"So, once again you break your word",3 stars
"The first was General Shatabali,",3 stars
what is your first impression?,3 stars
She is in Lanka,3 stars
King Sugreev.,3 stars
"If I may ask,",3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
Perhaps it is finally time,3 stars
Maybe we need to find,3 stars
if only we had turned back then,3 stars
Shurpanakha,3 stars
But I have felt it once...,3 stars
Her name is Ruma.,3 stars
Probably to discuss,3 stars
That... I do hear,3 stars
You can hide outside if you wish,3 stars
"So, Vaali took the crown",3 stars
I'll keep him distracted.,3 stars
There are other ways,3 stars
That must be why,3 stars
Perhaps the demon has run away?,3 stars
"brief though it is,",3 stars
Ma!,3 stars
"For many, there is no hope that",3 stars
"Now, that's not something you see",3 stars
"The vines, they're changing",3 stars
"And free of thought, too, apparently.",3 stars
Time passed while we were in the cave,3 stars
Princess Sita is on the far side of this,3 stars
He asked his brother,3 stars
"He is older, wiser.",3 stars
the three realms would shake,3 stars
"The vines, they're changing",3 stars
but the decision is yours alone.,3 stars
"we're different, Hanuman.",3 stars
enough to try.,3 stars
to properly search for Sita?,3 stars
"different about you, young Hanuman.",3 stars
"But, for some, it's about finding",3 stars
If only to shut you up.,3 stars
But Lakshman cautioned him,3 stars
is it complete?,3 stars
Probably to discuss,3 stars
The vaanars should have been,3 stars
I thought as much,3 stars
"Yes, of course.",3 stars
"There are darker forces at work here,",3 stars
Our time is up. We've failed,3 stars
Princess Sita...,3 stars
We're just in a dark forest,3 stars
That must be why,3 stars
to be found in the north,3 stars
"I found the anklet upon a tree branch,",3 stars
It's lucky it died when it did.,3 stars
"But, first, tell me everything",3 stars
"You know what Vaali is,",3 stars
then we'll need boats,3 stars
"We Vaalakhilya might be small,",3 stars
Have you quite finished?,3 stars
Perhaps they are merely lost.,3 stars
He has redeemed me.,3 stars
Okay! I can shorten our story,3 stars
to be found in the north,3 stars
"You're safe? But Shurpanakha, how?",3 stars
"Ma, I'm scared. What's happening?",3 stars
Does he look like he needs help?,3 stars
we don't know how much time,3 stars
"So, why don't you do us the honour",3 stars
"So, do you accept my challenge, hero?",3 stars
The same fight is also going on,3 stars
It would have to be one,3 stars
"And, for that very reason...",3 stars
but now...,3 stars
"So, once again you break your word",3 stars
Only if we're eager to die,3 stars
"Where Ram is,",3 stars
of younger brothers,3 stars
"Do you challenge me, monkey?",3 stars
But he is still my brother.,3 stars
We don't know what we're up against.,3 stars
They're still attacking though,3 stars
but belong to the same sky.,3 stars
Let me gather some supplies,3 stars
"Perhaps, for the first time,",3 stars
The vines are growing stronger,3 stars
That is why,3 stars
It's telling me of a mantra,3 stars
But I have felt it once...,3 stars
"Despite her flaws,",3 stars
I'll be back quickly,3 stars
that may break the spell,3 stars
I've become a better man,3 stars
we have to save Angad,3 stars
where Ravan was seen heading,3 stars
but her powers have grown,3 stars
Though the two Princes had been led astray,3 stars
That no matter how dark the night...,3 stars
the mighty Vaali could have defeated...,3 stars
That's good.,3 stars
because all he sees are shadows.,3 stars
All you've done is complain,3 stars
Did you know some say,3 stars
Ma!,3 stars
Time passed while we were in the cave,3 stars
I didn't save Angad; Hanuman did,3 stars
perhaps we have been stuck here so long,3 stars
"Yes, I thought that, too",3 stars
"Easy, Angad. I saw you were awake",3 stars
for I'm older and wiser,3 stars
It's bone.,3 stars
Someone will need to keep these young pups,3 stars
Despite the costs.,3 stars
Ravan,3 stars
Maybe.,3 stars
"perhaps, then,",3 stars
"When I was much younger,",3 stars
but he grew enamoured with this woman.,3 stars
"So, you end up inflicting it",3 stars
can be tricky.,3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
"In their ignorance, they might confuse you",3 stars
There are forces within him,3 stars
Angad.,3 stars
"Though I can't bear your burden as a king,",3 stars
but his heart is his weakness.,3 stars
"Actually, I'm probably more like you.",3 stars
He is young and inexperienced.,3 stars
they could be found,3 stars
Though the price was high,3 stars
Is that all you've got?,3 stars
Can you understand that?,3 stars
"I'll try, but this is different",3 stars
Do you think a few mangy rakshasas,3 stars
If we don't find Princess Sita,3 stars
But I would expect no less,3 stars
But you are wrong.,3 stars
The vines are growing stronger,3 stars
he had not overcome,3 stars
Ready?,3 stars
Though he doesn't yet realize it,3 stars
"but to condemn your own soldiers,",3 stars
Let me just rest for a while,3 stars
"perhaps, then,",3 stars
he decided that the only way to show,3 stars
Probably to discuss,3 stars
"Yet, you wish the great Sugreev",3 stars
Only we can stop them.,3 stars
when we first encountered Shurpanakha,3 stars
"I'll be fine, Angad",3 stars
"I don't know why,",3 stars
"If you fail to bring me Ram,",3 stars
Angad!,3 stars
But that's not for me,3 stars
Perhaps we could have Sampati search Lanka,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
would be a dish,3 stars
"But, until that grim day,",3 stars
Do you think otherwise?,3 stars
in case Mayavi somehow found a way back.,3 stars
Maybe it's food,3 stars
But the rakshasas are your enemy.,3 stars
what could be if you are not careful,3 stars
"Despite her flaws,",3 stars
"So, you end up inflicting it",3 stars
then that means...,3 stars
We would rather tell Sugreev himself.,3 stars
Though the price was high,3 stars
Tell him Shurpanakha has need of him.,3 stars
It's lucky it died when it did.,3 stars
Let me gather some supplies,3 stars
found the sight of us amusing,3 stars
"Ma, I'm scared. What's happening?",3 stars
Sugreev sent us on a mission,3 stars
I thought as much,3 stars
for I sensed Angad's pain,3 stars
A trick of the light perhaps?,3 stars
It'll only take a few minutes,3 stars
Though I'm pretty sure,3 stars
but his heart is his weakness.,3 stars
"For Angad, anything",3 stars
"I promised him I'd look after it,",3 stars
"If they worked together, they would share",3 stars
If we fail to find Princess Sita,3 stars
Yes. I'm afraid there's no way in or out,3 stars
the three realms would shake,3 stars
"in my forest, little monkey?",3 stars
What does the young monkey mean by that?,3 stars
Then who will tell me?,3 stars
but not the sea?,3 stars
"But to get rid of their light,",3 stars
"Well, those were some weird talking birds",3 stars
You need to help Angad,3 stars
But what do you offer in return?,3 stars
Okay! I can shorten our story,3 stars
Some truths must be revealed,3 stars
"Angad, what's happened to you?",3 stars
but he could not leave it at that.,3 stars
"The challenge is finished, Angad.",3 stars
if Princess Sita cannot be found.,3 stars
Destined to be the mother,3 stars
"For many, there is no hope that",3 stars
but he says promises have been broken.,3 stars
"Well, ""friend"" is a bit much",3 stars
did something to him.,3 stars
I was wondering,3 stars
"But, for some, it's about finding",3 stars
but to serve. He is not a prince.,3 stars
that sits in the heart,3 stars
Then it's okay.,3 stars
I see the elements at war,3 stars
but they're gone now.,3 stars
We're just in a dark forest,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
But you'd never even get close,3 stars
comes with a heavy weight,3 stars
"perhaps, then,",3 stars
and Ram would have remained happy,3 stars
between his legs,3 stars
"The first was General Shatabali,",3 stars
"But, as a child, you did not understand",3 stars
"If you fail to bring me Ram,",3 stars
"So that, in death, you may find peace.",3 stars
They'll get lost in the caves,3 stars
"If I am as you say, you may not like",3 stars
"Sugreev offered to help, but for that",3 stars
Princess Sita...,3 stars
"But please, we don't have much time",3 stars
"Yes, I understand. But how?",3 stars
that may break the spell,3 stars
"I don't know why,",3 stars
Destined to be the mother,3 stars
this whole story would be different,3 stars
Which means...,3 stars
"Perhaps, old bear. But if so,",3 stars
"I know, but it's time we prepare.",3 stars
"different about you, young Hanuman.",3 stars
My feet ache and look...,3 stars
Maybe there was.,3 stars
But you're brothers.,3 stars
"Angad, what's happened to you?",3 stars
May I ask why?,3 stars
Enough!,3 stars
"I'll be fine, Angad",3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
We should wait,3 stars
have to say.,3 stars
You want me gone to make sure Vaali's,3 stars
meagre as they are. You'll find nothing.,3 stars
Did you know,3 stars
"If you say so, Hanuman, but...",3 stars
Then it's okay.,3 stars
Or find Princess Sita,3 stars
But that's not for me,3 stars
"Yes, but you don't understand...",3 stars
"But for others,",3 stars
To be young,3 stars
I think we're about to find out.,3 stars
King Sugreev.,3 stars
I see swift free-jumping creatures,3 stars
Of ruling well?,3 stars
Let me get some sleep.,3 stars
Vaali was not always this way.,3 stars
If we fail to find Princess Sita,3 stars
You should have thought of that before,3 stars
that sits in the heart,3 stars
I needed to learn whether you were a friend,3 stars
Have you quite finished?,3 stars
"Hanuman, if we go to Rikshabila,",3 stars
where Ravan was seen heading,3 stars
Do you know how to find Sugreev?,3 stars
may be the only chance we have,3 stars
Perhaps someone else can go,3 stars
in case Angad fails.,3 stars
but belong to the same sky.,3 stars
will be preceded by much suffering.,3 stars
"Where Ram is,",3 stars
I could be impulsive.,3 stars
Ravan.,3 stars
I bet there are juicy berries,3 stars
"So, you end up inflicting it",3 stars
"However, your story is not one of failure.",3 stars
Perhaps someone else can go,3 stars
"are different,",3 stars
If we are to hold this girl's hands,3 stars
"Tell me, Angad",3 stars
They are telling me something,3 stars
"we're different, Hanuman.",3 stars
Anjana?,3 stars
We have to help him.,3 stars
I thought as much,3 stars
"If you say so, Hanuman, but...",3 stars
I thought it was a dream,3 stars
We do not know where Princess Sita is,3 stars
"What's the plan, Hanuman?",3 stars
Angad?,3 stars
I don't know which to believe,3 stars
"I know, but it's time we prepare.",3 stars
"King Sugreev,",3 stars
But Ram was determined,3 stars
"But he is in pain, Jambhvan",3 stars
Perhaps he is wise enough,3 stars
King Sugreev.,3 stars
"So, why don't you do us the honour",3 stars
But will his followers respect him?,3 stars
The honour of Kishkindha depends on it.,3 stars
"But tell me,",3 stars
"However, your story is not one of failure.",3 stars
"Women don't age, kind sir",3 stars
"And, for that very reason...",3 stars
"different about you, young Hanuman.",3 stars
but it would have a high cost,3 stars
It's just I'm not sure I can do this,3 stars
"Despite her flaws,",3 stars
"but, after meeting you, I feel whole.",3 stars
We may be able to help him.,3 stars
"Though exiled in the forest,",3 stars
That's easy. The one you feed,3 stars
"Then, I will reason with this.",3 stars
But you're brothers.,3 stars
"But he is in pain, Jambhvan",3 stars
after all that has happened?,3 stars
"I didn't at first, but it wouldn't have",3 stars
perhaps your search would already be over.,3 stars
"Yes, but he has been punished",3 stars
"Fun? If this is fun,",3 stars
Then we need to be stronger as well,3 stars
King Sugreev.,3 stars
Older,3 stars
"Yet, you wish the great Sugreev",3 stars
We should wait,3 stars
"Sugreev offered to help, but for that",3 stars
I don't know if I can help now,3 stars
Shurpanakha.,3 stars
We'll have the Princess back,3 stars
but you're starting to sound a bit cra...,3 stars
"With or without the vaanars help,",4 stars
just in case.,4 stars
Good. I promise,4 stars
after hearing what I thought,4 stars
for those around him.,4 stars
one of his advisors.,4 stars
He's an ally,4 stars
about your mistress,4 stars
"For saving Nirvani,",4 stars
Then you will have it,4 stars
until Shurpanakha stole the cave's power,4 stars
snivelling worm.,4 stars
"Yes, this is a good plan.",4 stars
"mimicking screams in Ram's voice,",4 stars
after hearing what I thought,4 stars
"by the demon Ravan,",4 stars
to hold on to what we have,4 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
"Lokvinashak, Dashaasan, Lankeshwar.",4 stars
Mayavi would devour his people.,4 stars
it will take there,4 stars
"for her own,",4 stars
that will respond well to it.,4 stars
"Good, you heard my singing",4 stars
Shurpanakha seemed to love Ram very much,4 stars
about your mistress,4 stars
but secretly your humble servant.,4 stars
"Flying without a care,",4 stars
"Yes, it certainly has.",4 stars
"Yes, it certainly has.",4 stars
I want a story.,4 stars
I will make sure she sees justice,4 stars
Lanka,4 stars
to know restraint.,4 stars
"mimicking screams in Ram's voice,",4 stars
until Shurpanakha stole the cave's power,4 stars
an appropriate greeting.,4 stars
"We have plenty of wood,",4 stars
Lanka,4 stars
"By consuming the rice pudding,",4 stars
It will be a difficult journey and well...,4 stars
for those around him.,4 stars
but my brother helped me control it.,4 stars
"Once they are dead, I will resume",4 stars
Children,4 stars
Mayavi would devour his people.,4 stars
An ashram where King Sugreev,4 stars
or how to find her,4 stars
is soon beginning.,4 stars
Hanuman,4 stars
If only I had your strength,4 stars
but a new time for our people.,4 stars
"By consuming the rice pudding,",4 stars
"I see. Well, young man,",4 stars
"A deal, then. Hanuman dies",4 stars
for a rakshas.,4 stars
"Lokvinashak, Dashaasan, Lankeshwar.",4 stars
winged lions at the peak of Mount Somagiri,4 stars
I am eager to meet him,4 stars
The age of Ravan began.,4 stars
He fulfilled his duty.,4 stars
The vines are still mine to control,4 stars
"Just give me a moment,",4 stars
find a way to reason with them.,4 stars
There is more at stake here,4 stars
